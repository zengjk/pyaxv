description of non-negligible interactions which require, at least in
principle, an exponential amount of information. Recently, in the context of
spin glasses and Boltzmann machines, it has been demonstrated that systematic
machine learning of the wave function can reduce these issues to a tractable
computational problem. In this work, we apply this approach to a different
situation, i.e. the problem of finding the ground state of a given quantum
system made of electrons, entirely described by its Hamiltonian operator, and
by utilizing feedforward neural networks. Although still in the shape of a
proof of concept, one can already observe that this seminal idea is able to
substantially simplify the complexity of this peculiar, and important, problem.

states to simulate the stationary states of open quantum many-body systems.
Using the high expressive power of the variational ansatz described by the
restricted Boltzmann machines, which we dub as the neural stationary state
ansatz, we compute the stationary states of quantum dynamics obeying the
Lindblad master equations. The mapping of the stationary-state search problem
into finding a zero-energy ground state of an appropriate Hermitian operator
allows us to apply the conventional variational Monte Carlo method for the
optimization. Our method is shown to simulate various spin systems efficiently,
i.e., the transverse-field Ising models in both one and two dimensions and the
XYZ model in one dimension.

isolated and the coupling to their environment needs to be taken into account.
Often, the effect of the environment can be well approximated by a Markovian
master equation. However, solving this master equation for quantum many-body
systems, becomes exceedingly hard due to the high dimension of the Hilbert
space. Here we present an approach to the effective simulation of the dynamics
of open quantum many-body systems based on machine learning techniques. We
represent the mixed many-body quantum states with neural networks in the form
of restricted Boltzmann machines and derive a variational Monte-Carlo algorithm
for their time evolution and stationary states. We document the accuracy of the
approach with numerical examples for a dissipative spin lattice system.

network based decoders, due to the good decoding performance achieved and
adaptability to any noise model. However, the main challenge is scalability to
larger code distances due to an exponential increase of the error syndrome
space. Note that, successfully decoding the surface code under realistic noise
assumptions will limit the size of the code to less than 100 qubits with
current neural network based decoders.
  Such a problem can be tackled by a distributed way of decoding, similar to
the Renormalization Group (RG) decoders. In this paper, we introduce a decoding
algorithm that combines the concept of RG decoding and neural network based
decoders. We tested the decoding performance under depolarizing noise with
noiseless error syndrome measurements for the rotated surface code and compared
against the Blossom algorithm and a neural network based decoder. We show that
similar level of decoding performance can be achieved between all tested
decoders while providing a solution to the scalability issues of neural network
based decoders.

  Applications","  One of the main challenges of quantum many-body physics is that the
dimensionality of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with the system size,
which makes it extremely difficult to solve the Schr\""{o}dinger equations of
the system. But typically, many physical systems have a simplified internal
structure which makes the parameters needed to characterize their ground states
exponentially smaller. This makes many numerical methods possible in capture
the physics of the system. Among these modern numerical techniques, neural
networks, which show great power in approximating functions and extracting
features of the big data, are now attracting many interests. Neural network
representation of quantum many-body states shows great potential in solving
some traditionally difficult quantum problems involving large number of
freedoms. In this work, we briefly review the progress of using the artificial
neural network to build quantum many-body ansatz states. We take Boltzmann
machine representation as a prototypical example to illustrate various aspects
of neural network representation of quantum many-body states. We first briefly
review the classical neural networks, then we illustrate how to use neural
networks to represent quantum states and density operators. Some physical
properties of the neural network states, including entanglement features,
representational power, and the relation with tensor network states, are
discussed. For applications, we briefly review the progress of many-body
calculating based on neural network states, neural network state approach to

  networks","  Quantum walks are at the heart of modern quantum technologies. They allow to
deal with quantum transport phenomena and are an advanced tool for constructing
novel quantum algorithms. Quantum walks on graphs are fundamentally different
from classical random walks analogs, in particular, they walk faster than
classical ones on certain graphs, enabling in these cases quantum algorithmic
applications and quantum-enhanced energy transfer. However, little is known
about the possible speedups on arbitrary graphs not having explicit symmetries.
For these graphs one would need to perform simulations of classical and quantum
walk dynamics to check if the speedup occurs, which could take a long
computational time. Here we present a new approach for the solution of the
quantum speedup problem, which is based on a machine learning algorithm that
detects the quantum advantage by just looking at a graph. The convolutional
neural network, which we designed specifically to learn from graphs, observes
simulated examples and learns complex features of graphs that lead to a quantum
speedup, allowing to identify graphs that exhibit quantum speedup without
performing any quantum walk or random walk simulations. Our findings pave the
way to an automated elaboration of novel large-scale quantum circuits utilizing
quantum walk based algorithms, and to simulating high-efficiency energy
transfer in biophotonics and material science.

  Network","  Noise and decoherence are two major obstacles to the implementation of
large-scale quantum computing. Because of the no-cloning theorem, which says we
cannot make an exact copy of an arbitrary quantum state, simple redundancy will
not work in a quantum context, and unwanted interactions with the environment
can destroy coherence and thus the quantum nature of the computation. Because
of the parallel and distributed nature of classical neural networks, they have
long been successfully used to deal with incomplete or damaged data. In this
work, we show that our model of a quantum neural network (QNN) is similarly
robust to noise, and that, in addition, it is robust to decoherence. Moreover,
robustness to noise and decoherence is not only maintained but improved as the
size of the system is increased. Noise and decoherence may even be of advantage
in training, as it helps correct for overfitting. We demonstrate the robustness
using entanglement as a means for pattern storage in a qubit array. Our results
provide evidence that machine learning approaches can obviate otherwise
recalcitrant problems in quantum computing.

researchers to apply these methods to problems in quantum information. Torlai

Since then, many other researchers have applied neural networks to study a
variety of problems in the context of decoding. An important development in
this regard was due to Varsamopoulos et al. who proposed a two-step decoder
using neural networks. Subsequent work of Maskara et al. used the same concept

decoder using inverse parity-check matrix for topological color codes. We show
that it outperforms the state-of-the-art performance of non-neural decoders for
independent Pauli errors noise model on a 2D hexagonal color code. Our final
decoder is independent of the noise model and achieves a threshold of $10 \%$.
Our result is comparable to the recent work on neural decoder for quantum error
correction by Maskara et al.. It appears that our decoder has significant
advantages with respect to training cost and complexity of the network for
higher lengths when compared to that of Maskara et al.. Our proposed method can
also be extended to arbitrary dimension and other stabilizer codes.

strong attention, especially for the simulation of associative memory in
Hopfield neural networks due to their wide applications and relatively simple
structures that allow for easier mapping to the quantum regime. Quantum
stochastic walk, a strikingly powerful tool to analyze quantum dynamics, has
been recently proposed to simulate the firing pattern and associative memory
with a dependence on Hamming Distance. We successfully map the theoretical
scheme into a three-dimensional photonic chip and realize quantum stochastic

deep neural networks are biased towards simple functions. The simplicity is
captured by the following two properties. For any given input bit string, the
average Hamming distance of the closest input bit string with a different
classification is at least $\sqrt{n\left/\left(2\pi\ln n\right)\right.}$, where
$n$ is the length of the string. Moreover, if the bits of the initial string
are flipped randomly, the average number of flips required to change the
classification grows linearly with $n$. On the contrary, for a uniformly random
binary classifier, the average Hamming distance of the closest input bit string
with a different classification is one, and the average number of random flips
required to change the classification is two. These results are confirmed by
numerical experiments on deep neural networks with two hidden layers, and
settle the conjecture stating that random deep neural networks are biased
towards simple functions. The conjecture that random deep neural networks are
biased towards simple functions was proposed and numerically explored in [Valle
P\'erez et al., arXiv:1805.08522] to explain the unreasonably good
generalization properties of deep learning algorithms. By providing a precise
characterization of the form of this bias towards simplicity, our results open
the way to a rigorous proof of the generalization properties of deep learning

given by the deformations of the loops. This fact can be mathematically
formalized by the fundamental group of the graph. Furthermore the neuron has
two basic states $|0\rangle$ (ground state) and $|1\rangle$ (excited state).
The whole state of an area of neurons is the linear combination of the two
basic state with complex coefficients representing the signals (with 3
Parameters: amplitude, frequency and phase) along the neurons. Then it can be
shown that the set of all signals forms a manifold (character variety) and all
properties of the network must be encoded in this manifold. In the paper, we
will discuss how to interpret learning and intuition in this model. Using the
Morgan-Shalen compactification, the limit for signals with large amplitude can
be analyzed by using quasi-Fuchsian groups as represented by dessins d'enfants
(graphs to analyze Riemannian surfaces). As shown by Planat and collaborators,
these dessins d'enfants are a direct bridge to (topological) quantum computing
with permutation groups. The normalization of the signal reduces to the group
$SU(2)$ and the whole model to a quantum network. Then we have a direct
connection to quantum circuits. This network can be transformed into operations

by making measurements on identical copies of the state. Current algorithms are
costly both on the experimental front -- requiring vast numbers of measurements
-- as well as in terms of the computational time to analyze those measurements.
In this paper, we address the problem of analysis speed and flexibility,
introducing \textit{Neural Adaptive Quantum State Tomography} (NA-QST), a
machine learning based algorithm for quantum state tomography that adapts
measurements and provides orders of magnitude faster processing while retaining
state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy. Our algorithm is inspired by particle
swarm optimization and Bayesian particle-filter based adaptive methods, which
we extend and enhance using neural networks. The resampling step, in which a
bank of candidate solutions -- particles -- is refined, is in our case learned
directly from data, removing the computational bottleneck of standard methods.
We successfully replace the Bayesian calculation that requires computational
time of $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ with a learned heuristic whose time complexity
empirically scales as $O(\log(n))$ with the number of copies measured $n$,
while retaining the same reconstruction accuracy. This corresponds to a factor
of a million speedup for $10^7$ copies measured. We demonstrate that our
algorithm learns to work with basis, symmetric informationally complete (SIC),
as well as other types of POVMs. We discuss the value of measurement adaptivity
for each POVM type, demonstrating that its effect is significant only for basis
POVMs. Our algorithm can be retrained within hours on a single laptop for a
two-qubit situation, which suggests a feasible time-cost when extended to
larger systems. It can also adapt to a subset of possible states, a choice of
the type of measurement, and other experimental details.

language translation, medical diagnosis and image recognition. It remains to be
seen if neural networks can be trained to predict stochastic quantum evolution

that a recurrent neural network can be trained in real time to infer the
individual quantum trajectories associated with the evolution of a
superconducting qubit under unitary evolution, decoherence and continuous

Hamiltonian, measurement operators and physical parameters. It is also able to

can be efficiently decoded by employing machine learning techniques like neural
networks. Various techniques employing neural networks have been used to
increase the decoding performance, however, there is no framework that analyses
a step-by-step procedure in designing such a neural network based decoder. The
main objective of this work is to present a detailed framework that
investigates the way that various neural network parameters affect the decoding
performance, the training time and the execution time of a neural network based
decoder. We focus on neural network parameters such as the size of the training
dataset, the structure, and the type of the neural network, the batch size and
the learning rate used during training. We compare various decoding strategies
and showcase how these influence the objectives for different error models. For
the noiseless syndrome measurements, we reach up to 50\% improvement against
the benchmark algorithm (Blossom) and for the noisy syndrome measurements, we
show efficient decoding performance up to 97 qubits for the rotated Surface
code. Furthermore, we show that the scaling of the execution time (time
calculated during the inference phase) is linear with the number of qubits,
which is a significant improvement compared to existing classical decoding
algorithms that scale polynomially with the number of qubits.

task is defined, a neural network needs to undergo a training phase in order to
calibrate the network parameters. On a classical computer, the number of
training cycles is strongly correlated with the amount of parameters in the
neural network, making an optimization of the parameters computationally
expensive. Here, we propose the a fully quantum training protocol for quantum
binary neurons. We show that for special cases this protocol yields a quadratic
advantage over commonly used classical training methods, and numerics suggests
that this advantage is generic for most instances. The source of this advantage
is the possibility to run training cycles in a quantum superposition. Further,
we present an extension of the training of single quantum binary neurons to
feedforward binary neural networks.

quantum state, we implement a novel ""quantumness gate"" that maps an arbitrary
matrix to the real representation of a positive hermitean normalized density
matrix. We train the CNOT gate, the Hadamard gate and a rotation in Hilbert
space as basic building blocks for processing the quantum density matrices of
two entangled qubits. During the training process the neural networks learn to
represent the complex structure, the hermiticity, the normalization and the
positivity of the output matrix. The requirement of successful training allows
us to find a critical bottleneck dimension which reflects the relevant quantum
information. Chains of individually trained neural quantum gates can be
constructed to realize any unitary transformation. For scaling to larger
quantum systems, we propose to use correlations of stochastic macroscopic
two-level observables or classical bits. This novel concept provides a path for
a classical implementation of computationally relevant quantum information
processing on classical neural networks, in particular on neuromorphic
computing machines featuring stochastic operations.

qubits. The network finds the physically relevant parameters, exploits

insights. For example, given a time series of the positions of the Sun and Mars
as observed from Earth, the network discovers the heliocentric model of the
solar system - that is, it encodes the data into the angles of the two planets
as seen from the Sun. Our work provides a first step towards answering the

naturally arise from the experimental data without any mathematical and

satisfy all needs of different experimental setups. Recently, a few neural
network based decoders have been studied, with the motivation that they can
adapt to a wide range of noise models, and can easily run on dedicated chips
without a full-fledged computer. The later feature might lead to fast speed and
the ability to operate in low temperature. However, a question which has not
been addressed in previous works is whether neural network decoders can handle
2D topological codes with large distances. In this work, we provide a positive
answer for the toric code. The structure of our neural network decoder is
inspired by the renormalization group decoder. With a fairly strict policy on
training time, when the bit-flip error rate is lower than $9\%$, the neural
network decoder performs better when code distance increases. With a less
strict policy, we find it is not hard for the neural decoder to achieve a
performance close to the minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm. The
numerical simulation is done up to code distance $d=64$. Last but not least, we
describe and analyze a few failed approaches. They guide us to the final design
of our neural decoder, but also serve as a caution when we gauge the

The most advanced challenges require discovering answers autonomously. This is

according to a reward function. The power of neural-network-based reinforcement
learning has been highlighted by spectacular recent successes, such as playing
Go, but its benefits for physics are yet to be demonstrated. Here, we show how

strategies, protecting a collection of qubits against noise. These strategies
require feedback adapted to measurement outcomes. Finding them from scratch,
without human guidance, tailored to different hardware resources, is a
formidable challenge due to the combinatorially large search space. To solve
this, we develop two ideas: two-stage learning with teacher/student networks
and a reward quantifying the capability to recover the quantum information
stored in a multi-qubit system. Beyond its immediate impact on quantum
computation, our work more generally demonstrates the promise of
neural-network-based reinforcement learning in physics.

classical or quantum, and be trained by supervised learning. The quantum
circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations
which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single Pauli
operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the
quantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state.
First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings
with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis
state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made
from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean
function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially
long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by
supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data
consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been
labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation
that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly
distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum
superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to different label
values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider
using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show
that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical
simulation of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with
near-term quantum processors in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this
QNN on a near term gate model quantum computer where its power can be explored

exponential resources. However, heuristic classical approaches are often very
efficient in approximately simulating special circuit structures, for example
with limited entanglement, or based on one-dimensional geometries. Here we
introduce a classical approach to the simulation of general quantum circuits
based on neural-network quantum states (NQS) representations. Considering a set
of universal quantum gates, we derive rules for exactly applying single-qubit
and two-qubit Z rotations to NQS, whereas we provide a learning scheme to
approximate the action of Hadamard gates. Results are shown for the Hadamard
and Fourier transform of entangled initial states for systems sizes and total
circuit depths exceeding what can be currently simulated with state-of-the-art
brute-force techniques. The overall accuracy obtained by the neural-network
states based on Restricted Boltzmann machines is satisfactory, and offers a
classical route to simulating highly-entangled circuits. In the test cases
considered, we find that our classical simulations are comparable to quantum
simulations affected by an incoherent noise level in the hardware of about

physically relevant states in the exponentially large Hilbert space is one of
the key tasks towards solving the quantum many-body problem. Powerful tools in
this context such as tensor network states have recently been complemented by
states derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs). Here, we propose and
investigate a new family of quantum states, coined generalized transfer matrix
states (GTMS), which bridges between the two mentioned approaches in the
framework of deep ANNs. In particular, we show by means of a constructive
embedding that the class of GTMS contains generic matrix product states while
at the same time being capable of capturing more long-ranged quantum
correlations that go beyond the area-law entanglement properties of tensor
networks. While generic deep ANNs are hard to contract, meaning that the
corresponding state amplitude can not be exactly evaluated, the GTMS network is
shown to be analytically contractible using transfer matrix methods. With
numerical simulations, we demonstrate how the GTMS network learns random matrix
product states in a supervised learning scheme, and how augmenting the network
by long-ranged couplings leads to the onset of volume-law entanglement scaling.
We argue that this capability of capturing long-range quantum correlations
makes GTMS a promising candidate for the study of critical and dynamical
quantum many-body systems.

Variational Monte Carlo, this ansatz has been applied to find Hamil- tonian
ground states and their energies. Here we provide extensions of this method to

eigenstates of a (nonlocal) symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Second, we give an
algorithm that allows to compute low-lying excited states without symmetries.
We demonstrate our approach with both Restricted Boltzmann machines states and
feedforward neural networks as variational wave-functions. Results are shown
for the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, and for the one-dimensional
Bose-Hubbard model. When comparing to available exact results, we obtain good

find that deep networks typically outperform shallow architectures for

generates an attracting force to simulate the quantum tunneling effect. In the
standard quantum annealing method, the quantum fluctuations will vanish at the
last stage of optimization. In this study, we propose a learning protocol that
utilizes a finite value for quantum fluctuations strength to obtain higher
generalization performance, which is a type of robustness. We demonstrate the
performance of our method using two well-known open datasets: the MNIST dataset
and the Olivetti face dataset. Although computational costs prevent us from
testing our method on large datasets with high-dimensional data, results show
that our method can enhance generalization performance by induction of the
finite value for quantum fluctuations.

network states to describe multipartite entanglement. We demonstrate that
neural network states are capable of efficiently representing quantum codes for
quantum information transmission and quantum error correction. In particular,
we show that a) neural network states yield quantum codes with a high coherent
information for two important quantum channels, the depolarizing channel and
the dephrasure channel; b) neural network states can be used to represent
absolutely maximally entangled states, a special type of quantum error

computers. The quantum neural network is a variational quantum circuit built in
the continuous-variable (CV) architecture, which encodes quantum information in
continuous degrees of freedom such as the amplitudes of the electromagnetic
field. This circuit contains a layered structure of continuously parameterized
gates which is universal for CV quantum computation. Affine transformations and
nonlinear activation functions, two key elements in neural networks, are
enacted in the quantum network using Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates,
respectively. The non-Gaussian gates provide both the nonlinearity and the
universality of the model. Due to the structure of the CV model, the CV quantum
neural network can encode highly nonlinear transformations while remaining
completely unitary. We show how a classical network can be embedded into the
quantum formalism and propose quantum versions of various specialized model
such as convolutional, recurrent, and residual networks. Finally, we present
numerous modeling experiments built with the Strawberry Fields software

given by thermal weights. This perspective permits the construction of a
dissipative -- yet quantum -- dynamics which encodes in its stationary state

quantum states and processes. However, the ability to optimally distinguish
various classes of quantum data is an important primitive in quantum
information science. In this work, we train near-term quantum circuits to
classify data represented by non-orthogonal quantum probability distributions
using the Adam stochastic optimization algorithm. This is achieved by iterative
interactions of a classical device with a quantum processor to discover the
parameters of an unknown non-unitary quantum circuit. This circuit learns to
simulates the unknown structure of a generalized quantum measurement, or
Positive-Operator-Value-Measure (POVM), that is required to optimally
distinguish possible distributions of quantum inputs. Notably we use universal
circuit topologies, with a theoretically motivated circuit design, which
guarantees that our circuits can in principle learn to perform arbitrary
input-output mappings. Our numerical simulations show that shallow quantum
circuits could be trained to discriminate among various pure and mixed quantum
states exhibiting a trade-off between minimizing erroneous and inconclusive
outcomes with comparable performance to theoretically optimal POVMs. We train
the circuit on different classes of quantum data and evaluate the
generalization error on unseen mixed quantum states. This generalization power
hence distinguishes our work from standard circuit optimization and provides an
example of quantum machine learning for a task that has inherently no classical
analogue.

error correction as it allows the decoder to adapt to the error distribution of
a quantum chip. An additional motivation for using neural networks is the fact
that they can be evaluated by dedicated hardware which is very fast and
consumes little power. Machine learning has been previously applied to decode
the surface code. However, these approaches are not scalable as the training
has to be redone for every system size which becomes increasingly difficult. In
this work the existence of local decoders for higher dimensional codes leads us
to use a low-depth convolutional neural network to locally assign a likelihood
of error on each qubit. For noiseless syndrome measurements, numerical
simulations show that the decoder has a threshold of around $7.1\%$ when
applied to the 4D toric code. When the syndrome measurements are noisy, the
decoder performs better for larger code sizes when the error probability is
low. We also give theoretical and numerical analysis to show how a
convolutional neural network is different from the 1-nearest neighbor
algorithm, which is a baseline machine learning method.

sequences have been developed to dynamically correct the error. Tailoring these

Our analysis is based on a full circuit-level noise model. It considers both
distance-three and five codes, and is performed near the codes pseudo-threshold
regime. Training deep neural decoders in low noise rate regimes appears to be a
challenging machine learning endeavour. We provide a detailed description of
our neural network architectures and training methodology. We then discuss both
the advantages and limitations of deep neural decoders. Lastly, we provide a
rigorous analysis of the decoding runtime of trained deep neural decoders and
compare our methods with anticipated gate times in future quantum devices.
Given the broad applications of our decoding schemes, we believe that the

quantum mechanics, where the complexity of the ground state appears to grow
exponentially with the size of the system. We address this problem with
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques: adversarial domain adaptation. We
derive the phase diagram of the whole parameter space starting from a fixed and
known subspace using unsupervised learning. The input data set contains both
labeled and unlabeled data instances. The first kind is a system that admits an
accurate analytical or numerical solution, and one can recover its phase
diagram. The second type is the physical system with an unknown phase diagram.
Adversarial domain adaptation uses both types of data to create invariant
feature extracting layers in a deep learning architecture. Once these layers
are trained, we can attach an unsupervised learner to the network to find phase
transitions. We show the success of this technique by applying it on several
paradigmatic models: the Ising model with different temperatures, the
Bose-Hubbard model, and the SSH model with disorder. The input is the ground
state without any manual feature engineering, and the dimension of the
parameter space is unrestricted. The method finds unknown transitions
successfully and predicts transition points in close agreement with standard
methods. This study opens the door to the classification of physical systems

problem or the Bose glass phase.

are strong connections between Neural-Network Quantum States in the form of
Restricted Boltzmann Machines and some classes of Tensor-Network states in

Boltzmann Machines are Entangled Plaquette States, while fully connected
Restricted Boltzmann Machines are String-Bond States with a nonlocal geometry
and low bond dimension. These results shed light on the underlying architecture
of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and their efficiency at representing many-body

power of Neural-Network Quantum States and a natural generalization to systems

  States","  It was recently proposed to leverage the representational power of artificial
neural networks, in particular Restricted Boltzmann Machines, in order to model
complex quantum states of many-body systems [Science, 355(6325), 2017]. States
represented in this way, called Neural Network States (NNSs), were shown to
display interesting properties like the ability to efficiently capture
long-range quantum correlations. However, identifying an optimal neural network
representation of a given state might be challenging, and so far this problem
has been addressed with stochastic optimization techniques. In this work we
explore a different direction. We study how the action of elementary quantum
operations modifies NNSs. We parametrize a family of many body quantum
operations that can be directly applied to states represented by Unrestricted
Boltzmann Machines, by just adding hidden nodes and updating the network
parameters. We show that this parametrization contains a set of universal
quantum gates, from which it follows that the state prepared by any quantum
circuit can be expressed as a Neural Network State with a number of hidden
nodes that grows linearly with the number of elementary operations in the
circuit. This is a powerful representation theorem (which was recently obtained
with different methods) but that is not directly useful, since there is no
general and efficient way to extract information from this unrestricted
description of quantum states. To circumvent this problem, we propose a
step-wise procedure based on the projection of Unrestricted quantum states to
Restricted quantum states. In turn, two approximate methods to perform this
projection are discussed. In this way, we show that it is in principle possible
to approximately optimize or evolve Neural Network States without relying on

two layers of hidden neurons mediate quantum correlations among physical

compact and exact network representations for the ground states are obtained
without stochastic optimization of the network parameters. The number of
neurons grows linearly with the system size and total imaginary time,
respectively. Physical quantities can be measured by sampling configurations of
both physical and neuron degrees of freedom. We provide specific examples for
the transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg models by implementing efficient

our approach is an alternative to the standard path integral, and it is
potentially useful also to systematically improve on numerical approaches based

decoders to the triangular color and toric codes under various noise models
with realistic features, such as spatially-correlated errors. We report that
neural decoders provide significant improvement over leading efficient decoders
in terms of the error-correction threshold. Using neural networks simplifies
the process of designing well-performing decoders, and does not require prior

the enhanced memory storage capacity in black holes and in brain networks, we
construct an artificial quantum neural network based on gravity-like synaptic

a critical state in which the gapless neurons emerge that appear to inhabit a

excitations of these neurons, the network can store and retrieve an
exponentially large number of patterns within an arbitrarily narrow energy gap.
The corresponding micro-state entropy of the brain network exhibits an area
law. The neural network can be described in terms of a quantum field, via
identifying the different neurons with the different momentum modes of the
field, while identifying the synaptic connections among the neurons with the
interactions among the corresponding momentum modes. Such a mapping allows to
attribute a well-defined sense of geometry to an intrinsically non-local
system, such as the neural network, and vice versa, it allows to represent the
quantum field model as a neural network.

allows one to reconstruct traditionally challenging many-body quantities - such
as the entanglement entropy - from simple, experimentally accessible

355, 602 (2017) introduced a new type sampleable ansatz called neural-network
quantum states (NQS) that are inspired by the restricted Boltzmann model used

NQS are a special form of CPS with novel properties. Diagramatically a number
of simple observations become transparent. Namely, that NQS are CPS built from
extensively sized GHZ-form correlators, which are related to a canonical
polyadic decomposition of a tensor, making them uniquely unbiased
geometrically. Another immediate implication of the equivalence to CPS is that
we are able to formulate exact NQS representations for a wide range of
paradigmatic states, including superposition of weighed-graph states, the
Laughlin state, toric code states, and the resonating valence bond state. These

is a proven method for the characterization of electrical neural activity and
has strongly contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms that govern
neural information processing. However, traditional recordings can only acquire
signals from a few positions simultaneously, which severely limits their
ability to characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural networks. We
suggest to radically extend the scope of this method using the wide-field
imaging of the neural magnetic fields across the slice by means of NV
magnetometry. Employing comprehensive computational simulations and theoretical
analyses, we characterize the spatiotemporal characteristics of the neural
magnetic fields and derive the required key performance parameters of an
imaging setup based on NV magnetometry. In particular, we determine how the
technical parameters determine the achievable spatial resolution for an optimal
reconstruction of the neural currents from the measured field distributions.
Finally, we compare the imaging of neural slice activity with that of a single
planar pyramidal cell. Our results suggest that imaging of neural slice
activity will be possible with the upcoming generation of NV magnetic field
sensors, while imaging of the activity of a single planar cell remains more
challenging.

fields, promises an unprecedented perspective for solving intricate quantum
many-body problems. Understanding the physical aspects of the representative
artificial neural-network states is recently becoming highly desirable in the
applications of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. Here,
we study the quantum entanglement properties of neural-network states, with a
focus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the
entanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary
dimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states we show by using
an exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement,
implying a notable capability of RBM in representing efficiently quantum states
with massive entanglement. We further examine generic RBM states with random
weight parameters. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys
volume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the
completely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no
universal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type
level statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is
capable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model
Hamiltonian with long-range interaction. In addition, we show, through a
concrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster
states, that the RBM representation may also be used as a tool to analytically
compute the entanglement spectrum. Our results uncover the unparalleled power
of artificial neural networks in representing quantum many-body states, which
paves a novel way to bridge computer science based machine learning techniques
to outstanding quantum condensed matter physics problems.

alleviated in the new model. It is shown that QNNs of logarithmic size and

field to investigate how quantum fluctuations affect the macroscopic behavior
of neural networks. When the number of embedded patterns is finite, the Trotter
decomposition reduces the problem to that of a random Ising model. It turns out
that the effects of quantum fluctuations on macroscopic variables play the same
roles as those of thermal fluctuations. For an extensive number of embedded
patterns, we apply the replica method to the Trotter-decomposed system. The
result is summarized as a ground-state phase diagram drawn in terms of the
number of patterns per site, $\alpha$, and the strength of the transverse
field, $\Delta$. The phase diagram coincides very accurately with that of the
conventional classical Hopfield model if we replace the temperature T in the
latter model by $\Delta$. Quantum fluctuations are thus concluded to be quite
similar to thermal fluctuations in determination of the macroscopic behavior of
the present model.

phases of Hopfield-type network models. The basic calculation is done for the
generalized version of the standard model introduced by Horner [1] and by
Perez-Vicente and Amit [2] which can exhibit low mean levels of neural
activity. For a mean activity $\bar a =1/2$ the Hopfield model is recovered. In
this case, surprisingly enough, we cannot confirm the well known one step
replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) result for the storage capacity which was
presented by Crisanti, Amit and Gutfreund [3] ($\alpha_c^{\hbox{\mf
1RSB}}\simeq 0.144$). Rather, we find that 1RSB- and 2RSB-Ans\""atze yield only
slightly increased capacities as compared to the replica symmetric value
($\alpha_c^{\hbox{\mf 1RSB}}\simeq 0.138\,186$ and $\alpha_c^{\hbox{\mf
2RSB}}\simeq 0.138\,187 $ compared to $\alpha_c^{\hbox{\mf RS}}\simeq
0.137\,905$), significantly smaller also than the value $\alpha_c^{\hbox{\mf
sim}} = 0.145\pm 0.009$ reported from simulation studies. These values still
lie within the recently discovered reentrant phase [4]. We conjecture that in
the infinite Parisi-scheme the reentrant behaviour disappears as is the case in
the SK-spin-glass model (Parisi--Toulouse-hypothesis). The same qualitative
results are obtained in the low activity range.

Hebb rule, a variant of the familiar Hebb rule, are studied in the presence of
noise(finite temperature), when the number of stored patterns is finite and in
the limit that the number of neurons $N\rightarrow
  \infty$. The fact that different patterns enter the synaptic rule with
different weights changes the configuration of the free energy surface. For a
general choice of weights not all of the patterns are stored as {\sl global}
minima of the free energy function. However, as for the case of the usual Hebb
rule, there exists a temperature range in which only the stored patterns are
minima of the free energy. In particular, in the presence of a single extra
pattern stored with an appropriate weight in the synaptic rule, the temperature
at which the spurious minima of the free energy are eliminated is significantly
lower than for a similar network without this extra pattern. The convergence
time of the network, together with the overlaps of the equilibria of the
network with the stored patterns, can thereby be improved considerably.

extended to study finite-temperature effects. The typical volume of the space
of interactions is calculated for strongly-diluted networks as a function of
the storage ratio $\alpha$, temperature $T$, and the tolerance parameter $m$,
from which the optimal storage capacity $\alpha_c$ is obtained as a function of
$T$ and $m$. At zero temperature it is found that $\alpha_c = 2$ regardless of
$m$ while $\alpha_c$ in general increases with the tolerance at finite
temperatures. We show how the best performance for given $\alpha$ and $T$ is
obtained, which reveals a first-order transition from high-quality performance
to low-quality one at low temperatures. An approximate criterion for recalling,
which is valid near $m=1$, is also discussed.

model. The system has a finite number of possible states so it is not possible
to use the term chaos in the usual sense of sensitive dependence on the initial
condition. Nevertheless, at varying the asymmetry parameter, $k$, one observes
a transition from ordered motion (i.e. short transients and short periods on
the attractors) to a ``complex'' temporal behaviour. This transition takes
place for the same value $k_{\rm c}$ at which one has a change for the mean
transient length from a power law in the size of the system ($N$) to an
exponential law in $N$. The ``complex'' behaviour during the transient shows
strong analogies with the chaotic behaviour: decay of temporal correlations,
positive Shannon entropy, non-constant Renyi entropies of different orders.
Moreover the transition is very similar to that one for the intermittent
transition in chaotic systems: scaling law for the Shannon entropy and strong
fluctuations of the ``effective Shannon entropy'' along the transient, for $k >

model. So far, various formulations of the decoding problem as the task of
machine learning have been proposed. Here, we discuss general constructions of

we establish that contemporary deep learning architectures, in the form of deep

entangled quantum systems. By constructing Tensor Network equivalents of these
architectures, we identify an inherent reuse of information in the network
operation as a key trait which distinguishes them from standard Tensor Network
based representations, and which enhances their entanglement capacity. Our
results show that such architectures can support volume-law entanglement
scaling, polynomially more efficiently than presently employed RBMs. Thus,
beyond a quantification of the entanglement capacity of leading deep learning
architectures, our analysis formally motivates a shift of trending
neural-network based wave function representations closer to the

algorithm to physics problems. These applications provide new platforms to
challenge the critical issue of how to uncover the black box of machine
learning because there always exists well-defined rules under physics problems.
The success of such efforts can offer great promise of discovering new physics
from experimental data by artificial intelligence. As a benchmark and a
proof-of-principle study that this approach is indeed possible, in this work we
design an introspective learning architecture that can automatically develop
the concept of the quantum wave function and discover the Schr\""odinger
equation from simulated experimental data of the potential-to-density mappings
of a quantum particle. This introspective learning architecture contains a
translator and a knowledge distiller. The translator employs a recurrent neural
network to learn the potential to density mapping, and the knowledge distiller
applies the auto-encoder to extract the essential information and its update
law from the hidden layer of the translator, which turns out to be the quantum
wave function and the Schr\""odinger equation. We envision that our
introspective learning architecture can enable machine learning to discover new
physics in the future.

to training a highly {\it generalizable} NN, to which numerous tuning skills
matured in machine learning can be transferred. This opens up a door through
which a family of robust control algorithms can be developed. We exemplify such
potential by introducing the commonly used trick of batch-based optimization,
and the resulting stochastic b-GRAPE algorithm is numerically shown to be able
to remarkably enhance the control robustness while maintaining high fidelity.

random access memories to store quantum-encoded data given a priori in a
classical description. The data acquisition process, however, has not been
accounted for, while it sets the ultimate limit of the usefulness of the data
for different SL tasks, as constrained by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. We
introduce supervised learning enhanced by an entangled sensor network (SLEEN)
as a means to carry out SL tasks at the physical layer where a quantum
advantage is achieved. The entanglement shared by different sensors boosts the
performance of extracting global features of the object under investigation. We
leverage SLEEN to construct an entanglement-enhanced support-vector machine for
quantum data classification and entanglement-enhanced principal component
analyzer for quantum data compression. In both schemes, variational circuits
are employed to seek the optimum entangled probe state and measurement settings
to maximize the entanglement-enabled quantum advantage. We compare the
performance of SLEEN with separable-state SL schemes and observe an appreciable
entanglement-enabled performance gain even in the presence of loss. SLEEN is
realizable with available technology, opening a viable route toward building
near-term quantum devices that offer unmatched performance beyond what the
optimum classical device is able to afford.

RBM ansazt in certain simple models, demonstrated in the literature. Based on
this relation, we improve the numerical algorithm to achieve better performance
of RBM in cases where local minima complicate the convergence to the global

capable of reproducing the perturbative structure, and show that their
performance is comparable to that of RBM. Furthermore, we study the performance
of a few-layer RBM for approximating ground states of random,
translationally-invariant models in 1d, as well as random matrix-product states
(MPS). We find that the error in approximating such states exhibits a broad

Recent works have succeeded in recovering the Hamiltonian of an isolated

observables alone, using computational and measurement resources scaling
linearly with the system size. In fact, to recover the Hamiltonian acting on
each finite spatial domain, only observables within that domain are required.
The observables can be measured in a Gibbs state as well as a single
eigenstate; furthermore, they can be measured in a state evolved by the
Hamiltonian for a long time, allowing to recover a large family of
time-dependent Hamiltonians. We derive an estimate for the statistical recovery
error due to approximation of expectation values using a finite number of

generalization, resulting of limited scope. The coherent transport by adiabatic
passage of a quantum state through an array of semiconductor quantum dots
provides a par excellence example of such approach, where it is necessary to
introduce its so called counter-intuitive control gate ansatz pulse sequence.
Instead, deep reinforcement learning technique has proven to be able to solve
very complex sequential decision-making problems involving competition between
short-term and long-term rewards, despite a lack of prior knowledge. We show
that in the above problem deep reinforcement learning discovers control
sequences outperforming the \textit{ansatz} counter-intuitive sequence. Even
more interesting, it discovers novel strategies when realistic disturbances
affect the ideal system, with better speed and fidelity when energy detuning
between the ground states of quantum dots or dephasing are added to the master
equation, also mitigating the effects of losses. This method enables online
update of realistic systems as the policy convergence is boosted by exploiting
the prior knowledge when available. Deep reinforcement learning proves
effective to control dynamics of quantum states, and more generally it applies
whenever an ansatz solution is unknown or insufficient to effectively treat the

the situation is not hopeless, for we know that nonlinear processes can be
embedded in unitary processes, as is familiar from the circuit model of quantum

manifests as the fundamental upper bound on the reusability. This limitation on
the reusability would increase the quantum access to the input data, i.e., the
usage of quantum random access memory (qRAM), repeating the preparation of a
superposition of `big' input data on the query failure. However, it is found
that, a learner can obtain a correct answer even from an unreliable oracle

mechanism, which consists of projective measurements in the register,
reinitialization of the register state and local conditional operations on the
agent and environment subspace, a powerful and flexible quantum machine
learning protocol emerges. Indeed, numerical simulations show that this

representation for stabilizer code states and find the exact RBM representation
for several types of stabilizer groups with the number of hidden neurons equal

full-scale quantum computer. Over the past few years, many quantum machine
learning algorithms have been proposed that can potentially offer considerable
speedups over the corresponding classical algorithms. In this paper, we
introduce q-means, a new quantum algorithm for clustering which is a canonical
problem in unsupervised machine learning. The $q$-means algorithm has
convergence and precision guarantees similar to $k$-means, and it outputs with
high probability a good approximation of the $k$ cluster centroids like the
classical algorithm. Given a dataset of $N$ $d$-dimensional vectors $v_i$ (seen
as a matrix $V \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d})$ stored in QRAM, the running time
of q-means is $\widetilde{O}\left( k d \frac{\eta}{\delta^2}\kappa(V)(\mu(V) +
k \frac{\eta}{\delta}) + k^2 \frac{\eta^{1.5}}{\delta^2} \kappa(V)\mu(V)
\right)$ per iteration, where $\kappa(V)$ is the condition number, $\mu(V)$ is
a parameter that appears in quantum linear algebra procedures and $\eta =
\max_{i} ||v_{i}||^{2}$. For a natural notion of well-clusterable datasets, the
running time becomes $\widetilde{O}\left( k^2 d \frac{\eta^{2.5}}{\delta^3} +
k^{2.5} \frac{\eta^2}{\delta^3} \right)$ per iteration, which is linear in the
number of features $d$, and polynomial in the rank $k$, the maximum square norm
$\eta$ and the error parameter $\delta$. Both running times are only
polylogarithmic in the number of datapoints $N$. Our algorithm provides
substantial savings compared to the classical $k$-means algorithm that runs in
time $O(kdN)$ per iteration, particularly for the case of large datasets.

real-valued parameters corresponds to Grover's celebrated search algorithm, can
a variational algorithm recover these settings and hence learn Grover's
algorithm? We studied several constrained variations of this problem and
answered this question in the affirmative, with some caveats. Grover's quantum
search algorithm is optimal up to a constant. The success probability of
Grover's algorithm goes from unity for two-qubits, decreases for three- and
four-qubits and returns near unity for five-qubits then oscillates
ever-so-close to unity, reaching unity in the infinite qubit limit. The
variationally approach employed here found an experimentally discernible
improvement of $5.77\%$ and $3.95\%$ for three- and four-qubits respectively.
Our findings are interesting as an extreme example of variational search, and
illustrate the promise of using hybrid quantum classical approaches to improve
quantum algorithms. This paper further demonstrates that to find optimal
parameters one doesn't need to vary over a family of quantum circuits to find
an optimal solution. This result looks promising and points out that there is a
set of variational quantum problems with parameters that can be efficiently
found on a classical computer for arbitrary number of qubits.

Reinforcement learning, an interactive form of learning, is, in turn, vital in
artificial intelligence-type applications. Also in this case, quantum mechanics
was shown to be useful, in certain instances. Here, we elucidate these results,

those that meta-learn. While not all learning models meta-learn, all
non-trivial models have the potential of being ""lifted"", enhanced, to
meta-learning models. Our results show that also such models can be

a method which realizes these variants, with minimal changes in the setting,
and with no corruption of the operative specification of the environments. This

overlap ${\rm Tr}(\rho\sigma)$ between two quantum states $\rho$ and $\sigma$.
The standard algorithm for this task, known as the Swap Test, is used in many
applications such as quantum support vector machines, and, when specialized to
$\rho = \sigma$, quantifies the Renyi entanglement. Here, we find algorithms
that have shorter depths than the Swap Test, including one that has a constant
depth (independent of problem size). Furthermore, we apply our approach to the
hardware-specific connectivity and gate sets used by Rigetti's and IBM's
quantum computers and demonstrate that the shorter algorithms that we derive
significantly reduce the error - compared to the Swap Test - on these
computers.

learning paradigm, we assume that the machine can be trained by $n$ qubits

$\{(x_1,c^*(x_1)),(x_2,c^*(x_2)),\dots\}$, where $\{x_1,x_2, \dots\}$ are
computational basis states sampled from an unknown distribution $D$ and
$\{c^*(x_1),c^*(x_2),\dots\}$ are the (possibly mixed) quantum states outputted
by $c^*$. The special case of PAC-learning quantum process under constant input
reduces to a natural problem which we named as approximate state
discrimination, where we are given copies of an unknown quantum state $c^*$
from an known finite set $C$, and we want to learn with probability $1-\delta$

the outputs are pure states and $$O\left(\frac{\log^3 |C|(\log |C|+\log(1/

implications of our results are that we can PAC-learn a polynomial sized
quantum circuit in polynomial samples and approximate state discrimination can
be solved in polynomial samples even when concept class size $|C|$ is

  learning","  Machine learning employs dynamical algorithms that mimic the human capacity
to learn, where the reinforcement learning ones are among the most similar to
humans in this respect. On the other hand, adaptability is an essential aspect
to perform any task efficiently in a changing environment, and it is
fundamental for many purposes, such as natural selection. Here, we propose an
algorithm based on successive measurements to adapt one quantum state to a
reference unknown state, in the sense of achieving maximum overlap. The
protocol naturally provides many identical copies of the reference state, such
that in each measurement iteration more information about it is obtained. In
our protocol, we consider a system composed of three parts, the ""environment""
system, which provides the reference state copies; the register, which is an
auxiliary subsystem that interacts with the environment to acquire information
from it; and the agent, which corresponds to the quantum state that is adapted
by digital feedback with input corresponding to the outcome of the measurements
on the register. With this proposal we can achieve an average fidelity between
the environment and the agent of more than $90\% $ with less than $30$
iterations of the protocol. In addition, we extend the formalism to $ d
$-dimensional states, reaching an average fidelity of around $80\% $ in less
than $400$ iterations for $d=$ 11, for a variety of genuinely quantum and
semiclassical states. This work paves the way for the development of quantum
reinforcement learning protocols using quantum data and for the future

high-dimensional probability distributions from data. The quantum computing
community has recently begun to generalise this idea and to look for potential
applications. In this work, we derive an adversarial algorithm for the problem
of approximating an unknown quantum pure state. Although this could be done on
universal quantum computers, the adversarial formulation enables us to execute
the algorithm on near-term quantum computers. Two parametrized circuits are
optimized in tandem: One tries to approximate the target state, the other tries
to distinguish between target and approximated state. Supported by numerical
simulations, we show that resilient backpropagation algorithms perform
remarkably well in optimizing the two circuits. We use the bipartite
entanglement entropy to design an efficient heuristic for the stopping

non-integrable many-body quantum systems of interacting qubits. RL methods
learn about the underlying physical system solely through a single scalar

research is done, from designing new materials and predicting their properties
to assisting drug discovery to advancing cybersecurity. Recently, we added to
this list by showing how a machine learning algorithm (a so-called learner)
combined with an optimization routine can assist experimental efforts in the
realm of tuning semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices. Among other
applications, semiconductor QDs are a candidate system for building quantum
computers. The present-day tuning techniques for bringing the QD devices into a
desirable configuration suitable for quantum computing that rely on heuristics
do not scale with the increasing size of the quantum dot arrays required for
even near-term quantum computing demonstrations. Establishing a reliable
protocol for tuning that does not rely on the gross-scale heuristics developed
by experimentalists is thus of great importance. To implement the machine
learning-based approach, we constructed a dataset of simulated QD device
characteristics, such as the conductance and the charge sensor response versus
the applied electrostatic gate voltages. Here, we describe the methodology for
generating the dataset, as well as its validation in training convolutional
neural networks. We show that the learner's accuracy in recognizing the state
of a device is ~96.5 % in both current- and charge-sensor-based training. We
also introduce a tool that enables other researchers to use this approach for
further research: QFlow lite - a Python-based mini-software suite that uses the
dataset to train neural networks to recognize the state of a device and
differentiate between states in experimental data. This work gives the
definitive reference for the new dataset that will help enable researchers to
use it in their experiments or to develop new machine learning approaches and

challenging, due to the complexities in fully modeling such systems accurately
and the difficulties in controlling these inherently fragile systems
experimentally. For example, while protocols to decompress Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC) faster than the adiabatic timescale (without excitation or
loss) have been well developed theoretically, experimental implementations of
these protocols have yet to reach speeds faster than the adiabatic timescale.
In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an alternative approach based on a
machine learning algorithm which makes progress towards this goal. The
algorithm is given control of the coupled decompression and transport of a
metastable helium condensate, with its performance determined after each
experimental iteration by measuring the excitations of the resultant BEC. After
each iteration the algorithm adjusts its internal model of the system to create
an improved control output for the next iteration. Given sufficient control
over the decompression, the algorithm converges to a novel solution that sets
the current speed record in relation to the adiabatic timescale, beating out
other experimental realizations based on theoretical approaches. This method
presents a feasible approach for implementing fast state preparations or
transformations in other quantum systems, without requiring a solution to a
theoretical model of the system. Implications for fundamental physics and
cooling are discussed.

introduces quantum statistics for classical data. These statistics may violate
the Bell inequality, as in the quantum case. We show that quantum learning

cryptography. In strong ""quantum access"" security models, numerous
symmetric-key cryptosystems are also vulnerable. We consider classical
encryption in a model which grants the adversary quantum oracle access to
encryption and decryption, but where the latter is restricted to non-adaptive
(i.e., pre-challenge) queries only. We define this model formally using
appropriate notions of ciphertext indistinguishability and semantic security
(which are equivalent by standard arguments) and call it QCCA1 in analogy to
the classical CCA1 security model. Using a bound on quantum random-access
codes, we show that the standard PRF- and PRP-based encryption schemes are
QCCA1-secure when instantiated with quantum-secure primitives.
  We then revisit standard IND-CPA-secure Learning with Errors (LWE) encryption
and show that leaking just one quantum decryption query (and no other queries

recovering the key uses a linear number of decryption queries, and this is
optimal. The algorithm at the core of our attack is a (large-modulus version

In turn, this allows us to solve problems that are not amenable, in general, to
direct analytical solution, providing at the same time a high degree of
flexibility over the types of gate-design problems that can be approached. As a
significant example, we find generators for the Toffoli gate using only

results that showed only quadratic improvements. A key step in the proof is to
construct task environments that encode well-known oracle problems, such as
Simon's problem and Recursive Fourier Sampling, while satisfying the above
""naturalness"" conditions for reinforcement learning. Our results suggest that
quantum agents may perform well in certain game-playing scenarios, where the
game has recursive structure, and the agent can learn by playing against
itself.

control strategy with machine learning, specifically, artificial neural
networks trained through supervised learning. Two designs are presented and
illustrated where the feedforward neural network and the general regression
neural network are used to select control schemes and design Lyapunov
functions, respectively. Since the sample generation and the training of neural

reconstruction of a given bulk operator will often necessarily depend on the
choice of black hole microstate, an example of state dependence. As a result,
whether a given bulk operator can be reconstructed on the boundary at all can
depend on whether the black hole is described by a pure state or thermal
ensemble. We refine this dichotomy, demonstrating that the same boundary
operator can often be used for large subspaces of black hole microstates,
corresponding to a constant fraction $\alpha$ of the black hole entropy. In the
Schrodinger picture, the boundary subregion encodes the $\alpha$-bits (a
concept from quantum information) of a bulk region containing the black hole
and bounded by extremal surfaces. These results have important consequences for
the structure of AdS/CFT and for quantum information. Firstly, they imply that
the bulk reconstruction is necessarily only approximate and allow us to place
non-perturbative lower bounds on the error when doing so. Second, they provide
a simple and tractable limit in which the entanglement wedge is
state-dependent, but in a highly controlled way. Although the state dependence
of operators comes from ordinary quantum error correction, there are clear
connections to the Papadodimas-Raju proposal for understanding operators behind
black hole horizons. In tensor network toy models of AdS/CFT, we see how state
dependence arises from the bulk operator being `pushed' through the black hole
itself. Finally, we show that black holes provide the first `explicit' examples
of capacity-achieving $\alpha$-bit codes. Unintuitively, Hawking radiation
always reveals the $\alpha$-bits of a black hole as soon as possible. In an
appendix, we apply a result from the quantum information literature to prove
that entanglement wedge reconstruction can be made exact to all orders in
$1/N$.

near-term devices. The result is a unified framework where classical and
quantum computing can benefit from the same theoretical and algorithmic
developments, and the same model can be trained classically then transferred to
the quantum setting for additional optimization. Tensor network circuits can
also provide qubit-efficient schemes where, depending on the architecture, the
number of physical qubits required scales only logarithmically with, or
independently of the input or output data sizes. We demonstrate our proposals
with numerical experiments, training a discriminative model to perform
handwriting recognition using a optimization procedure that could be carried
out on quantum hardware, and testing the noise resilience of the trained model.

sensors for temperature, strain, electric fields and, most notably, for
magnetic fields. However, the cryogenic temperatures required for low-noise
single-shot readout that have enabled the most sensitive NV-magnetometry
reported to date, are impractical for key applications, e.g. biological
sensing. Overcoming the noisy readout at room-temperature has until now
demanded repeated collection of fluorescent photons, which increases the
time-cost of the procedure thus reducing its sensitivity. Here we show how
machine learning can process the noisy readout of a single NV centre at
room-temperature, requiring on average only one photon per algorithm step, to
sense magnetic field strength with a precision comparable to those reported for
cryogenic experiments. Analysing large data sets from NV centres in bulk
diamond, we report absolute sensitivities of $60$ nT s$^{1/2}$ including
initialisation, readout, and computational overheads. We show that dephasing

modern physics because it requires an amount of computational resources that
scales exponentially with the size of the system.Simulating the evolution of a
state, or even storing its description, rapidly becomes intractable for exact
classical algorithms. Recently, machine learning techniques, in the form of
restricted Boltzmann machines, have been proposed as a way to efficiently
represent certain quantum states with applications in state tomography and
ground state estimation. Here, we introduce a new representation of states
based on variational autoencoders. Variational autoencoders are a type of
generative model in the form of a neural network. We probe the power of this
representation by encoding probability distributions associated with states
from different classes. Our simulations show that deep networks give a better
representation for states that are hard to sample from, while providing no
benefit for random states. This suggests that the probability distributions
associated to hard quantum states might have a compositional structure that can
be exploited by layered neural networks. Specifically, we consider the
learnability of a class of quantum states introduced by Fefferman and Umans.
Such states are provably hard to sample for classical computers, but not for
quantum ones, under plausible computational complexity assumptions. The good
level of compression achieved for hard states suggests these methods can be
suitable for characterising states of the size expected in first generation
quantum hardware.

Entanglement characterizes here the importance of data, and such information
are practically used to guide the architecture of MPS, and improve the

principle, a central theme upon which we construct multiple universal
optimization heuristics for training both parametrized quantum circuits and
classical deep neural networks on a quantum computer. Baqprop encodes error
information in relative phases of a quantum wavefunction defined over the space
of network parameters; it can be thought of as the unification of the phase
kickback principle of quantum computation and of the backpropagation algorithm
from classical deep learning. We propose two core heuristics which leverage
Baqprop for quantum-enhanced optimization of network parameters: Quantum
Dynamical Descent (QDD) and Momentum Measurement Gradient Descent (MoMGrad).
QDD uses simulated quantum coherent dynamics for parameter optimization,
allowing for quantum tunneling through the hypothesis space landscape. MoMGrad
leverages Baqprop to estimate gradients and thereby perform gradient descent on
the parameter landscape; it can be thought of as the quantum-classical analogue
of QDD. In addition to these core optimization strategies, we propose various
methods for parallelization, regularization, and meta-learning as augmentations
to MoMGrad and QDD. We introduce several quantum-coherent adaptations of
canonical classical feedforward neural networks, and study how Baqprop can be
used to optimize such networks. We develop multiple applications of parametric
circuit learning for quantum data, and show how to perform Baqprop in each
case. One such application allows for the training of hybrid quantum-classical
neural-circuit networks, via the seamless integration of Baqprop with classical
backpropagation. Finally, for a representative subset of these proposed
applications, we demonstrate the training of these networks via numerical

  rate estimation in quantum error correction","  Quantum error correction is important to quantum information processing,
which allows us to reliably process information encoded in quantum error
correction codes. Efficient quantum error correction benefits from the
knowledge of error rates. We propose a protocol for monitoring error rates in
real time without interrupting the quantum error correction. Any adaptation of
the quantum error correction code or its implementation circuit is not
required. The protocol can be directly applied to the most advanced quantum
error correction techniques, e.g. surface code. A Gaussian processes algorithm
is used to estimate and predict error rates based on error correction data in
the past. We find that using these estimated error rates, the probability of
error correction failures can be significantly reduced by a factor increasing
with the code distance.

sequence of predetermined experiments and post-processing the resulting data.
It is known that online design, where the choice of the next experiment is
based on the most up-to-date knowledge about the system, can offer speedups to
parameter estimation. We apply online Bayesian experiment design to a Nitrogen
Vacancy (NV) in diamond to learn the values of a five-parameter model
describing its Hamiltonian and decoherence process. Comparing this to standard
pre-determined experiment sweeps, we find that we can achieve median posterior
variances on some parameters that are between 10 and 100 times better given the
same amount of data. This has applications to NV magnetometry where one of the
Hamiltonian coefficients is the parameter of interest. Furthermore, the methods
that we use are generic and can be adapted to any quantum device.

systematic methodology of sampling-based learning control (SLC) approach with a
gradient flow algorithm for the design of robust quantum unitary

optimal control strategy robust against certain ranges of uncertainties. Then a
number of randomly selected samples are tested and the performance is evaluated
according to their average fidelity. The approach is applied to three typical
examples of robust quantum transformation problems including robust quantum
transformations in a three-level quantum system, in a superconducting quantum
circuit, and in a spin chain system. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the SLC approach and show its potential applications in
various implementation of quantum unitary transformations.

potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously
untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for
pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the most
well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations
to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes
large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A
core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the
exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable
entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement
two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the
feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage
of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced
solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and
operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set
in direct analogy to conventional SVMs. In the second, a quantum kernel
estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier
directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the
applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine
learning.

that outperforms human intelligence, even if limited knowledge and data are
provided. Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides one such possibility to reach
this goal. In this work, we consider a specific task from quantum physics, i.e.
quantum state transfer in a one-dimensional spin chain. The mission for the
machine is to find transfer schemes with fastest speeds while maintaining high
transfer fidelities. The first scenario we consider is when the Hamiltonian is
time-independent. We update the coupling strength by minimizing a loss function
dependent on both the fidelity and the speed. Compared with a scheme proven to
be at the quantum speed limit for the perfect state transfer, the scheme
provided by RL is faster while maintaining the infidelity below $5\times
10^{-4}$. In the second scenario where a time-dependent external field is
introduced, we convert the state transfer process into a Markov decision
process that can be understood by the machine. We solve it with the deep
Q-learning algorithm. After training, the machine successfully finds transfer
schemes with high fidelities and speeds, which are faster than previously known
ones. These results show that Reinforcement Learning can be a powerful tool for
quantum control problems.

basic idea of our method is to learn a unitary operation $\hat{U}$ that
transforms a given unknown state $|\psi_\tau\rangle$ to a known fiducial state
$|f\rangle$. Then, after completion of the learning process, we can estimate
and reproduce $|\psi_\tau\rangle$ based on the learned $\hat{U}$ and
$|f\rangle$. To realize this idea, we cast a random-based learning algorithm,
called `single-shot measurement learning,' in which the learning rule is based
on an intuitive and reasonable criterion: the greater the number of success (or
failure), the less (or more) changes are imposed. Remarkably, the learning
process occurs by means of a single-shot measurement outcome. We demonstrate
that our method works effectively, i.e., the learning is completed with a {\em
finite} number, say $N$, of unknown-state copies. Most surprisingly, our method
allows the maximum statistical accuracy to be achieved for large $N$, namely
$\simeq O(N^{-1})$ scales of average infidelity. This result is comparable to
those yielded from the standard quantum tomographic method in the case where
additional information is available. It highlights a non-trivial message, that
is, a random-based adaptive strategy can potentially be as accurate as other
standard statistical approaches.

classical machine learning: a generator tries to create statistics for data
that mimics those of a true data set, while a discriminator tries to
discriminate between the true and fake data. The learning process for generator
and discriminator can be thought of as an adversarial game, and under
reasonable assumptions, the game converges to the point where the generator
generates the same statistics as the true data and the discriminator is unable
to discriminate between the true and the generated data. This paper introduces
the notion of quantum generative adversarial networks (QuGANs), where the data
consists either of quantum states, or of classical data, and the generator and
discriminator are equipped with quantum information processors. We show that
the unique fixed point of the quantum adversarial game also occurs when the
generator produces the same statistics as the data. Since quantum systems are
intrinsically probabilistic the proof of the quantum case is different from -
and simpler than - the classical case. We show that when the data consists of
samples of measurements made on high-dimensional spaces, quantum adversarial
networks may exhibit an exponential advantage over classical adversarial
networks.

speed and fidelity of quantum computation against both leakage and stochastic
control errors. For a broad family of two-qubit unitary gates that are
important for quantum simulation of many-electron systems, we improve the
control robustness by adding control noise into training environments for
reinforcement learning agents trained with trusted-region-policy-optimization.
The agent control solutions demonstrate a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in

to a one-order-of-magnitude reduction in gate time from optimal gate synthesis

  Quantum Learning","  We give two new quantum algorithms for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs)
providing quantum speed-ups. We consider SDP instances with $m$ constraint
matrices, each of dimension $n$, rank $r$, and sparsity $s$. The first
algorithm assumes an input model where one is given access to entries of the
matrices at unit cost. We show that it has run time
$\tilde{O}(s^2(\sqrt{m}\epsilon^{-10}+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-12}))$, where
$\epsilon$ is the error. This gives an optimal dependence in terms of $m, n$
and quadratic improvement over previous quantum algorithms when $m\approx n$.
The second algorithm assumes a fully quantum input model in which the matrices
are given as quantum states. We show that its run time is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m}+\text{poly}(r))\cdot\text{poly}(\log m,\log
n,B,\epsilon^{-1})$, with $B$ an upper bound on the trace-norm of all input
matrices. In particular the complexity depends only poly-logarithmically in $n$
and polynomially in $r$.
  We apply the second SDP solver to the problem of learning a good description
of a quantum state with respect to a set of measurements: Given $m$
measurements and copies of an unknown state $\rho$, we show we can find in time
$\sqrt{m}\cdot\text{poly}(\log m,\log n,r,\epsilon^{-1})$ a description of the
state as a quantum circuit preparing a density matrix which has the same
expectation values as $\rho$ on the $m$ measurements, up to error $\epsilon$.
The density matrix obtained is an approximation to the maximum entropy state
consistent with the measurement data considered in Jaynes' principle from
statistical mechanics.
  As in previous work, we obtain our algorithm by ""quantizing"" classical SDP
solvers based on the matrix multiplicative weight method. One of our main
technical contributions is a quantum Gibbs state sampler for low-rank
Hamiltonians with a poly-logarithmic dependence on its dimension, which could
be of independent interest.

Computational complexity considerations of the quantum sampling problem suggest
that the quantum circuits exhibit stronger expressibility compared to classical

projective measurements on qubits. However, similar to the leading implicit
generative models in deep learning, such as the generative adversarial
networks, the quantum circuits cannot provide the likelihood of the generated
samples, which poses a challenge to the training. We devise an efficient

minimizing the kerneled maximum mean discrepancy loss. We simulated generative

estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable

data, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the
training of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this
concept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well
from this hybrid quantum-classical framework.

In many cases, including in quantum-dot based architectures, the parameter
space grows substantially with the number of qubits, and may become a limit to
scalability. Fortunately, machine learning techniques for pattern recognition
and image classification using so-called deep neural networks have shown
surprising successes for computer-aided understanding of complex systems. In
this work, we use deep and convolutional neural networks to characterize states
and charge configurations of semiconductor quantum dot arrays when one can only
measure a current-voltage characteristic of transport (here conductance)
through such a device. For simplicity, we model a semiconductor nanowire
connected to leads and capacitively coupled to depletion gates using the
Thomas-Fermi approximation and Coulomb blockade physics. We then generate
labelled training data for the neural networks, and find at least $90\,\%$
accuracy for charge and state identification for single and double dots purely
from the dependence of the nanowire's conductance upon gate voltages. Using
these characterization networks, we can then optimize the parameter space to
achieve a desired configuration of the array, a technique we call
`auto-tuning'. Finally, we show how such techniques can be implemented in an
experimental setting by applying our approach to an experimental data set, and
outline further problems in this domain, from using charge sensing data to
extensions to full one and two-dimensional arrays, that can be tackled with
machine learning.

to artificial intelligence. In our approach, the projective simulation system
is challenged to design complex photonic quantum experiments that produce
high-dimensional entangled multiphoton states, which are of high interest in
modern quantum experiments. The artificial intelligence system learns to create
a variety of entangled states, and improves the efficiency of their
realization. In the process, the system autonomously (re)discovers experimental
techniques which are only now becoming standard in modern quantum optical
experiments - a trait which was not explicitly demanded from the system but
emerged through the process of learning. Such features highlight the
possibility that machines could have a significantly more creative role in
future research.

challenges in state-of-the-art quantum annealers have to be overcome before we
can assess their actual performance. The sparse connectivity, resulting from
the local interaction between quantum bits in physical hardware

use embedding techniques to add redundancy to data sets, allowing us to
increase the modeling capacity of quantum annealers. We illustrate our findings

handwritten digits and two synthetic data sets in experiments with up to 940
quantum bits. Our model can be trained in quantum hardware without full
knowledge of the effective parameters specifying the corresponding quantum
Gibbs-like distribution; therefore, this approach avoids the need to infer the

quantum metrology. The latter represents one of the most relevant applications
of quantum theory, potentially enabling the capability of measuring unknown
physical parameters with improved precision over classical strategies. Within
this context, most theoretical and experimental studies have focused on
determining the fundamental bounds and how to achieve them in the asymptotic
regime where a large number of resources is employed. However, in most
applications it is necessary to achieve optimal precisions by performing only a
limited number of measurements. To this end, machine learning techniques can be
applied as a powerful optimization tool. Here, we implement experimentally
single-photon adaptive phase estimation protocols enhanced by machine learning,
showing the capability of reaching optimal precision after a small number of
trials. In particular, we introduce a new approach for Bayesian estimation that
exhibit best performances for very low number of photons N. Furthermore, we
study the resilience to noise of the tested methods, showing that the optimized
Bayesian approach is very robust in the presence of imperfections. Application
of this methodology can be envisaged in the more general multiparameter case,
that represents a paradigmatic scenario for several tasks including imaging or

quantum regime have been proposed, but all proposals collided with the
difficulty of implementing non-linear activation functions, which is essential
for classical neurons, due to the linear nature of quantum mechanics. Here we
propose a solution to this roadblock in the form of a small quantum circuit
that naturally simulates neurons with threshold activation. Our quantum circuit
defines a building block, the ""quantum neuron"", that can reproduce a variety of
classical neural network constructions while maintaining the ability to process
superpositions of inputs and preserve quantum coherence and entanglement. In
the construction of feedforward networks of quantum neurons, we provide
numerical evidence that the network not only can learn a function when trained
with superposition of inputs and the corresponding output, but that this
training suffices to learn the function on all individual inputs separately.
When arranged to mimic Hopfield networks, quantum neural networks exhibit
properties of associative memory. Patterns are encoded using the simple Hebbian
rule for the weights and we demonstrate attractor dynamics from corrupted
inputs. Finally, the fact that our quantum model closely captures (traditional)

after several decades of improvement where applications are to explode in many
fields of science, industry, and technology. Here, we use artificial neural
networks to study an intriguing phenomenon in quantum physics--- the
topological phases of matter. We find that certain topological states, either
symmetry-protected or with intrinsic topological order, can be represented with
classical artificial neural networks. This is demonstrated by using three
concrete spin systems, the one-dimensional (1D) symmetry-protected topological
cluster state and the 2D and 3D toric code states with intrinsic topological
orders. For all three cases we show rigorously that the topological ground
states can be represented by short-range neural networks in an \textit{exact}
and \textit{efficient} fashion---the required number of hidden neurons is as
small as the number of physical spins and the number of parameters scales only
\textit{linearly} with the system size. For the 2D toric-code model, we find
that the proposed short-range neural networks can describe the excited states
with abelain anyons and their nontrivial mutual statistics as well. In
addition, by using reinforcement learning we show that neural networks are
capable of finding the topological ground states of non-integrable Hamiltonians
with strong interactions and studying their topological phase transitions. Our
results demonstrate explicitly the exceptional power of neural networks in
describing topological quantum states, and at the same time provide valuable
guidance to machine learning of topological phases in generic lattice models.

discuss a number of ways that quantum information can be used to help make
quantum classifiers more secure or private. In particular, we demonstrate a

demonstrate this approach we introduce a linear combinations of unitaries
Hamiltonian simulation method that we show functions when given an imprecise

new quantum approach for bagging and boosting that can use quantum
superposition over the classifiers or splits of the training set to aggregate
over many more models than would be possible classically. Finally, we provide a
private form of $k$--means clustering that can be used to prevent an all
powerful adversary from learning more than a small fraction of a bit from any
user. These examples show the role that quantum technologies can play in the
security of ML and vice versa. This illustrates that quantum computing can

where quantum computer could provide exponential speedup over any classical

applications where quantum computer may offer significant speedup. Several
quantum algorithms for discriminative machine learning have been found based on
efficient solving of linear algebraic problems, with potential exponential
speedup in runtime under the assumption of effective input from a quantum

previous work on HQMMs with three contributions: (1) we show how classical

reformulate HQMMs by relaxing the constraints for modeling HMMs on quantum
circuits, and (3) we present a learning algorithm to estimate the parameters of
an HQMM from data. While our algorithm requires further optimization to handle
larger datasets, we are able to evaluate our algorithm using several synthetic
datasets. We show that on HQMM generated data, our algorithm learns HQMMs with
the same number of hidden states and predictive accuracy as the true HQMMs,
while HMMs learned with the Baum-Welch algorithm require more states to match
the predictive accuracy.

kernel principal component analysis and one-class support vector machine. We
find corresponding quantum algorithms to detect anomalies in quantum states. We
show that these two quantum algorithms can be performed using resources
logarithmic in the dimensionality of quantum states. For pure quantum states,
these resources can also be logarithmic in the number of quantum states used
for training the machine learning algorithm. This makes these algorithms

becoming increasingly fruitful. The vision is that such methods will,
eventually, be used to simulate theories in $(3+1)$ dimensions in regimes
difficult for other methods. So far, however, TN methods have mostly simulated
lattice gauge theories in $(1+1)$ dimensions. The aim of this paper is to
explore the simulation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) on infinite lattices
with TNs, i.e., fermionic matter fields coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field,
directly in the thermodynamic limit. With this idea in mind we first consider a
gauge-invariant iDMRG simulation of the Schwinger model -i.e., QED in
$(1+1)d$-. After giving a precise description of the numerical method, we
benchmark our simulations by computing the substracted chiral condensate in the
continuum, in good agreement with other approaches. Our simulations of the
Schwinger model allow us to build intuition about how a simulation should
proceed in $(2+1)$ dimensions. Based on this, we propose a variational ansatz
using infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) to describe the ground
state of $(2+1)d$ QED. The ansatz includes $U(1)$ gauge symmetry at the level
of the tensors, as well as fermionic (matter) and bosonic (gauge) degrees of
freedom both at the physical and virtual levels. We argue that all the
necessary ingredients for the simulation of $(2+1)d$ QED are, a priori, already
in place, paving the way for future upcoming results.

emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our
society. The respective underlying fields of research -- quantum information
(QI) versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) -- have
their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely
independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been
probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from
each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML,
investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve
the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both
directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital
application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our ""big data"" world.
Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become
instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in
data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments,
quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning,
highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works
exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for
performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first
successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also
broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts.
This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a

examples are necessary and sufficient for a learner to output, with probability
$1-\delta$, a hypothesis $h$ that is $\eps$-close to the target concept $c$. In
the related agnostic model, where the samples need not come from a $c\in C$, we
know that $$ \Theta\Big(\frac{d}{\eps^2} + \frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\eps^2}\Big)

that quantum examples are more powerful than classical examples in some
fixed-distribution settings. However, Atici and Servedio, improved by Zhang,
showed that in the PAC setting, quantum examples cannot be much more powerful:
the required number of quantum examples is $$

complexity are in fact equal up to constant factors in both the PAC and

information-theoretic argument that yields the above two classical bounds and
yields the same bounds for quantum sample complexity up to a $\log(d/\eps)$

on analyzing the behavior of the ""Pretty Good Measurement"" on the quantum state

alternative means that in order to complete the task, one needs a measurement

from the properties of classical information that break down in the quantum

an efficient means for classifying quantum state. For instance, one may want to
determine if a given quantum state is entangled or not. However, the process of
a complete characterization of quantum states, known as quantum state
tomography, is a resource-consuming operation in general. An attractive
proposal would be the use of Bell's inequalities as an entanglement witness,
where only partial information of the quantum state is needed. The problem is
that entanglement is necessary but not sufficient for violating Bell's
inequalities, making it an unreliable state classifier. Here we aim at solving
this problem by the methods of machine learning. More precisely, given a family
of quantum states, we randomly picked a subset of it to construct a
quantum-state classifier, accepting only partial information of each quantum
state. Our results indicated that these transformed Bell-type inequalities can
perform significantly better than the original Bell's inequalities in
classifying entangled states. We further extended our analysis to three-qubit

machine learning applications. Formal understanding on what makes these
networks so successful is gradually unfolding, but for the most part there are
still significant mysteries to unravel. The inductive bias, which reflects
prior knowledge embedded in the network architecture, is one of them. In this
work, we establish a fundamental connection between the fields of quantum
physics and deep learning. We use this connection for asserting novel
theoretical observations regarding the role that the number of channels in each
layer of the convolutional network fulfills in the overall inductive bias.
Specifically, we show an equivalence between the function realized by a deep
convolutional arithmetic circuit (ConvAC) and a quantum many-body wave
function, which relies on their common underlying tensorial structure. This
facilitates the use of quantum entanglement measures as well-defined
quantifiers of a deep network's expressive ability to model intricate
correlation structures of its inputs. Most importantly, the construction of a
deep ConvAC in terms of a Tensor Network is made available. This description
enables us to carry a graph-theoretic analysis of a convolutional network, with
which we demonstrate a direct control over the inductive bias of the deep
network via its channel numbers, that are related to the min-cut in the
underlying graph. This result is relevant to any practitioner designing a
network for a specific task. We theoretically analyze ConvACs, and empirically
validate our findings on more common ConvNets which involve ReLU activations
and max pooling. Beyond the results described above, the description of a deep
convolutional network in well-defined graph-theoretic tools and the formal
connection to quantum entanglement, are two interdisciplinary bridges that are
brought forth by this work.

devices and validating underpinning physical models, are central challenges for
the development of quantum technologies and for our continued understanding of
foundational physics. Machine-learning enhanced by quantum simulators has been
proposed as a route to improve the computational cost of performing these
studies. Here we interface two different quantum systems through a classical
channel - a silicon-photonics quantum simulator and an electron spin in a
diamond nitrogen-vacancy centre - and use the former to learn the latter's
Hamiltonian via Bayesian inference. We learn the salient Hamiltonian parameter
with an uncertainty of approximately $10^{-5}$. Furthermore, an observed
saturation in the learning algorithm suggests deficiencies in the underlying
Hamiltonian model, which we exploit to further improve the model itself. We go
on to implement an interactive version of the protocol and experimentally show
its ability to characterise the operation of the quantum photonic device. This
work demonstrates powerful new quantum-enhanced techniques for investigating
foundational physical models and characterising quantum technologies.

anneal to a desired ground state. We demonstrate successful learning to produce
an entangled state for a two-qubit system, then demonstrate generalizability to

size of the system increases. Because current technologies limit measurement of
the states of quantum annealing machines to determination of the average spin
at each site, we then construct a ""broken pathway"" between the initial and
desired states, at each step of which the average spins are nonzero, and show
successful learning of that pathway. Using this technique we show we can direct
annealing to multiqubit GHZ and W states, and verify that we have done so.

Second, we employ predictive feedback during sequential but time delayed

measuring instruments are not passively reading predetermined values of
physical observables. Counterfactual definiteness allows proving Bell
inequalities. If the contextual character of quantum measurements is correctly
taken into account the proofs of these inequalities may not be done. In recent
computer simulations of idealized Bell experiment predetermined successive
outcomes of measurements for each setting and predetermined time delays of
their registrations are calculated. Time windows and time delays are used to
select various samples. Correlations, estimated using these selected samples
are consistent with the predictions of quantum theory and the time window
dependence is similar to the dependence observed in some real experiments. It
is an important example how correlations can be explained without evoking
quantum non-locality. However by using a suitable post-selection one may prove
anything. Since before the post-selection generated samples may not violate
Bell inequalities as significantly as finite samples generated using quantum
predictions thus one may not conclude that counterfactual definiteness is not
able to distinguish classical from quantum physics. Moreover we show that for
each choice of a time window there exists a contextual hidden variable
probabilistic model consistent with the post-selection procedure used by the
authors what explains why they are able to reproduce quantum predictions.

successfully used the wave-particle duality of single photons to solve the
two-armed bandit problem, which constitutes the foundation of reinforcement
learning and decision making. In this study, we propose and confirm a
hierarchical architecture for single-photon-based reinforcement learning and
decision making that verifies the scalability of the principle. Specifically,
the four-armed bandit problem is solved given zero prior knowledge in a
two-layer hierarchical architecture, where polarization is autonomously adapted
in order to effect adequate decision making using single-photon measurements.
In the hierarchical structure, the notion of layer-dependent decisions emerges.
The optimal solutions in the coarse layer and in the fine layer, however,
conflict with each other in some contradictive problems. We show that while
what we call a tournament strategy resolves such contradictions, the
probabilistic nature of single photons allows for the direct location of the
optimal solution even for contradictive problems, hence manifesting the
exploration ability of single photons. This study provides insights into photon

  applications: A case study with possible applications in deep learning","  An increase in the efficiency of sampling from Boltzmann distributions would
have a significant impact on deep learning and other machine-learning
applications. Recently, quantum annealers have been proposed as a potential
candidate to speed up this task, but several limitations still bar these
state-of-the-art technologies from being used effectively. One of the main
limitations is that, while the device may indeed sample from a Boltzmann-like
distribution, quantum dynamical arguments suggest it will do so with an {\it
instance-dependent} effective temperature, different from its physical
temperature. Unless this unknown temperature can be unveiled, it might not be
possible to effectively use a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling. In this
work, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge with a simple
effective-temperature estimation algorithm. We provide a systematic study
assessing the impact of the effective temperatures in the learning of a special
class of a restricted Boltzmann machine embedded on quantum hardware, which can
serve as a building block for deep-learning architectures. We also provide a
comparison to $k$-step contrastive divergence (CD-$k$) with $k$ up to 100.
Although assuming a suitable fixed effective temperature also allows us to
outperform one step contrastive divergence (CD-1), only when using an
instance-dependent effective temperature do we find a performance close to that
of CD-100 for the case studied here.

channel properties. They are described by an update rule that is inspired by

PS with the ability for generalization, offered by its physical embodiment as a

problems that are prohibitively expensive for a classical computer. Most
problems with a proven quantum advantage involve the repeated use of a black
box, or oracle, whose structure encodes the solution. One measure of the
algorithmic performance is the query complexity, i.e., the scaling of the
number of oracle calls needed to find the solution with a given probability.
Few-qubit demonstrations of quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch-Jozsa and
Grover, have been implemented across diverse physical systems such as nuclear
magnetic resonance, trapped ions, optical systems, and superconducting
circuits. However, at the small scale, these problems can already be solved
classically with a few oracle queries, and the attainable quantum advantage is
modest. Here we solve an oracle-based problem, known as learning parity with
noise, using a five-qubit superconducting processor. Running classical and
quantum algorithms on the same oracle, we observe a large gap in query count in
favor of quantum processing. We find that this gap grows by orders of magnitude
as a function of the error rates and the problem size. This result demonstrates
that, while complex fault-tolerant architectures will be required for universal
quantum computing, a quantum advantage already emerges in existing noisy

Neural Network (QNN) by combining the merits of quantum computing and neural
computing. In order to exploit the advantages of the two prolific fields, the
QNN must meet the non-trivial task of integrating the unitary dynamics of
quantum computing and the dissipative dynamics of neural computing. At the core
of quantum computing and neural computing lies the qubit and perceptron,
respectively. We see that past implementations of the quantum perceptron model
have failed to fuse the two elegantly. This was due to a slow learning rule and
a disregard for the unitary requirement. In this paper, we present a quantum
perceptron that can compute functions uncomputable by the classical perceptron
while analytically solving for parameters and preserving the unitary and
dissipative requirements.

the ability of small quantum devices to learn. We specifically examine the
question in the context of Bayesian inference, wherein the prior and posterior
distributions are encoded in the quantum state vector. We conclude based on
lower bounds from Grover's search that an efficient blackbox method for
updating the distribution is impossible. We then address this by providing a
new adaptive form of approximate quantum Bayesian inference that is
polynomially faster than its classical analogue and tractable if the quantum
system is augmented with classical memory or if the low-order moments of the
distribution are protected using a repetition code. This work suggests that
there may be a connection between fault tolerance and the capacity of a quantum
system to learn from its surroundings.

compared to games made for fun or education. They are part of an actual science
problem solving process: By playing, players help scientists, and thereby
interact with real continuous research processes. This mixes the two worlds of
play and science in new ways. During usability testing we discovered that users
of the crowdscience game Quantum Dreams tended to answer questions in game
terms, even when directed explicitly to give science explanations.We then
examined these competing frames of understanding through a mixed correlational
and grounded theory analysis. This essay presents the core ideas of
crowdscience games as learning opportunities, and reports how a group of
players used ""game"", ""science"" and ""conceptual"" frames to interpret their
experience. Our results suggest that oscillating between the frames instead of
sticking to just one led to the largest number of correct science
interpretations, as players could participate legitimately and autonomously at
multiple levels of understanding.

  in the Tavis-Cummings model?","  We revisit the problem of the dynamics of quantum correlations in the exact
Tavis-Cummings model. We show that many of the dynamical features of quantum
discord attributed to dissipation are already present in the exact framework
and are due to the well known non-linearities in the model and to the choice of
initial conditions. Through a comprehensive analysis, supported by explicit
analytical calculations, we find that the dynamics of entanglement and quantum
discord are far from being trivial or intuitive. In this context, we find
states that are indistinguishable from the point of view of entanglement and
distinguishable from the point of view of quantum discord, states where the two
quantifiers give opposite information and states where they give roughly the
same information about correlations at a certain time. Depending on the initial
conditions, this model exhibits a fascinating range of phenomena that can be
used for experimental purposes such as: Robust states against change of
manifold or dissipation, tunable entanglement states and states with a
counterintuitive sudden birth as the number of photons increase. We furthermore
propose an experiment called quantum discord gates where discord is zero or
non-zero depending on the number of photons.

  approach","  Adaptive data collection and analysis, where data are being fed back to
update the measurement settings, can greatly increase speed, precision, and
reliability of the characterization of quantum systems. However, decoherence
tends to make adaptive characterization difficult. As an example, we consider
two coupled discrete quantum systems. When one of the systems can be controlled
and measured, the standard method to characterize another, with an unknown
frequency $\omega_{\rm r}$, is swap spectroscopy. Here, adapting measurements
can provide estimates whose error decreases exponentially in the number of
measurement shots rather than as a power law in conventional swap spectroscopy.
However, when the decoherence time is so short that an excitation oscillating
between the two systems can only undergo less than a few tens of vacuum Rabi
oscillations, this approach can be marred by a severe limit on accuracy unless
carefully designed. We adopt machine learning techniques to search for
efficient policies for the characterization of decohering quantum systems. We
find, for instance, that when the system undergoes more than 2 Rabi
oscillations during its relaxation time $T_1$, $O(10^3)$ measurement shots are
sufficient to reduce the squared error of the Bayesian initial prior of the
unknown frequency $\omega_{\rm r}$ by a factor $O(10^4)$ or larger. We also
develop policies optimized for extreme initial parameter uncertainty and for
the presence of imperfections in the readout.

are computers at solving this task? This question is both of philosophical and
practical interest because a positive answer would allow an artificial
intelligence to understand the physical world. Quantum mechanics is the most
fundamental physical theory and there is a deep belief that nature follows the
rules of quantum mechanics. Hence, we raise the question whether computers are
able to learn optimal quantum models from measured data. Here we show that in
the absence of physical heuristics, the inference of optimal quantum models
cannot be computed efficiently (unless P = NP). This result illuminates
rigorous limits to the extent to which computers can be used to further our
understanding of nature.

improvements are at all possible depends on the internal structure of the
quantum environment. If the environments are constructed and the internal
structure is appropriately chosen, or if the agent has limited capacities to
influence the internal states of the environment, we show that improvements in
learning times are possible in a broad range of scenarios. Such scenarios we
call luck-favoring settings. The case of constructed environments is
particularly relevant for the class of model-based learning agents, where our
results imply a near-generic improvement.

used to classify high dimensional vectors and may provide a new viewpoint and

in the development of practical quantum technology. In this paper, we present a
systematic numerical methodology of sampling-based learning control (SLC) for
control design of quantum systems with uncertainties. The SLC method includes
two steps of ""training"" and ""testing"". In the training step, an augmented
system is constructed using artificial samples generated by sampling
uncertainty parameters according to a given distribution. A gradient flow based
learning algorithm is developed to find the control for the augmented system.
In the process of testing, a number of additional samples are tested to
evaluate the control performance where these samples are obtained through
sampling the uncertainty parameters according to a possible distribution. The
SLC method is applied to three significant examples of quantum robust control
including state preparation in a three-level quantum system, robust
entanglement generation in a two-qubit superconducting circuit and quantum
entanglement control in a two-atom system interacting with a quantized field in
a cavity. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SLC approach
even when uncertainties are quite large, and show its potential for robust
control design of quantum systems.

strategies superior to those developed via simplified models. We describe an
online optimization algorithm based on Gaussian processes and apply it to
optimization of the production of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). BEC is
typically created with an exponential evaporation ramp that is approximately
optimal for s-wave, ergodic dynamics with two-body interactions and no other
loss rates, but likely sub-optimal for many real experiments. Machine learning
using a Gaussian process, in contrast, develops a statistical model of the
relationship between the parameters it controls and the quality of the BEC
produced. This is an online process, and an active one, as the Gaussian process
model updates on the basis of each subsequent experiment and proposes a new set
of parameters as a result. We demonstrate that the Gaussian process machine
learner is able to discover a ramp that produces high quality BECs in 10 times
fewer iterations than a previously used online optimization technique.
Furthermore, we show the internal model developed can be used to determine
which parameters are essential in BEC creation and which are unimportant,
providing insight into the optimization process.

Hamiltonians. This leads to a new application for small quantum computers:
characterizing and controlling larger quantum computers. Our protocol achieves
this by using Bayesian inference in concert with Lieb-Robinson bounds and
interactive quantum learning methods to achieve compressed simulations for
characterization. Whereas Fisher information analysis shows that current
methods which employ short-time evolution are suboptimal, interactive quantum
learning allows us to overcome this limitation. We illustrate the efficiency of
our bootstrapping protocol by showing numerically that an 8-qubit Ising model
simulator can be used to calibrate and control a 50 qubit Ising simulator while
using only about 750 kilobits of experimental data.

machine learning. The results demonstrate the working principle of using

autonomous learning agents has recently been reported in the context of the

the key feature of a PS agent, a specific type of memory which is explored via
random walks, was shown to be amenable to quantization. In particular,
classical random walks were substituted by Szegedy-type quantum walks, allowing
for a speed-up. In this work we propose how such classical and quantum agents
can be implemented in systems of trapped ions. We employ a generic construction
by which the classical agents are `upgraded' to their quantum counterparts by
nested coherent controlization, and we outline how this construction can be
realized in ion traps. Our results provide a flexible modular architecture for
the design of PS agents. Furthermore, we present numerical simulations of
simple PS agents which analyze the robustness of our proposal under certain

  Completely-Positive Realization Problem","  Among several tasks in Machine Learning, a specially important one is that of
inferring the latent variables of a system and their causal relations with the
observed behavior. Learning a Hidden Markov Model of given stochastic process
is a textbook example, known as the positive realization problem (PRP). The PRP
and its solutions have far-reaching consequences in many areas of systems and
control theory, and positive systems theory.
  We consider the scenario where the latent variables are quantum states, and
the system dynamics is constrained only by physical transformations on the
quantum system. The observable dynamics is then described by a quantum
instrument, and the task is to determine which quantum instrument --if any--
yields the process at hand by iterative application.
  We take as starting point the theory of quasi-realizations, whence a
description of the dynamics of the process is given in terms of linear maps on
state vectors and probabilities are given by linear functionals on the state
vectors. This description, despite its remarkable resemblance with the Hidden
Markov Model, or the iterated quantum instrument, is nevertheless devoid of any
stochastic or quantum mechanical interpretation, as said maps fail to satisfy
any positivity conditions. The Completely-Positive realization problem then
consists in determining whether an equivalent quantum mechanical description of
the same process exists.
  We generalize some key results of stochastic realization theory, and show
that the problem has deep connections with operator systems theory, yielding
possible insight to the lifting problem in quotient operator systems. Our
results have potential applications in quantum machine learning,

states of light. This is a problem of technological relevance for the reading
of information stored in a digital memory. In our setting, a coherent light
source is used to illuminate a memory cell and retrieve its encoded bit by
determining the quantum state of the reflected signal. We consider a situation
where the amplitude of the states produced by the source is not fully known,
but instead this information is encoded in a large training set comprising many
copies of the same coherent state. We show that an optimal global measurement,
performed jointly over the signal and the training set, provides higher
successful identification rates than any learning strategy based on first
estimating the unknown amplitude by means of Gaussian measurements on the
training set, followed by an adaptive discrimination procedure on the signal.
By considering a simplified variant of the problem, we argue that this is the
case even for non-Gaussian estimation measurements. Our results show that, even
in absence of entanglement, collective quantum measurements yield an
enhancement in the readout of classical information, which is particularly

When $h$ is the XOR or the OR function, this gives a restricted variant of the

  We analyse the general case using the adversary bound, and give an

Ising spins, as well as suitable penalty terms for enforcing the constraints
necessary for the reformulation; our proposed method requires $\mathcal O(n^2)$
qubits for $n$ Bayesian network variables. Furthermore, we prove lower bounds

resulting from the mapping has the appealing property that it is

examples in order to interpret new inputs. This is important for tasks such as
image and speech recognition or strategy optimisation, with growing
applications in the IT industry. In the last couple of years, researchers
investigated if quantum computing can help to improve classical machine
learning algorithms. Ideas range from running computationally costly algorithms
or their subroutines efficiently on a quantum computer to the translation of
stochastic methods into the language of quantum theory. This contribution gives
a systematic overview of the emerging field of quantum machine learning. It
presents the approaches as well as technical details in an accessable way, and
discusses the potential of a future theory of quantum learning.

settings it can be an unlikely ally. We consider the problem of learning the
class of $n$-bit parity functions by making queries to a quantum example
oracle. In the absence of noise, quantum and classical parity learning are easy
and almost equally powerful, both information-theoretically and
computationally. We show that in the presence of noise this story changes
dramatically. Indeed, the classical learning problem is believed to be
intractable, while the quantum version remains efficient. Depolarizing the
qubits at the oracle's output at any constant nonzero rate does not increase
the computational (or query) complexity of quantum learning more than
logarithmically. However, the problem of learning from corresponding classical
examples is the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, for which the best
known algorithms have superpolynomial complexity. This creates the possibility
of observing a quantum advantage with a few hundred noisy qubits. The presence
of noise is essential for creating this quantum-classical separation.

  correlations","  The problem of discriminating the state of a quantum system among a number of
hypothetical states is usually addressed under the assumption that one has
perfect knowledge of the possible states of the system. In this thesis, I
analyze the role of the prior information available in facing such problems,
and consider scenarios where the information regarding the possible states is
incomplete. In front of a complete ignorance of the possible states' identity,
I discuss a quantum ""programmable"" discrimination machine for qubit states that
accepts this information as input programs using a quantum encoding, rather
than as a classical description. The optimal performance of these machines is
studied for general qubit states when several copies are provided, in the
schemes of unambiguous, minimum-error, and error-margin discrimination. Then,
this type of automation in discrimination tasks is taken further. By realizing
a programmable machine as a device that is trained through quantum information
to perform a specific task, I propose a quantum ""learning"" machine for
classifying qubit states that does not require a quantum memory to store the
qubit programs and, nevertheless, performs as good as quantum mechanics
permits. Such learning machine thus allows for several optimal uses with no
need for retraining. A similar learning scheme is also discussed for coherent
states of light. I present it in the context of the readout of a classical
memory by means of classically correlated coherent signals, when these are
produced by an imperfect source. I show that, in this case, the retrieval of
information stored in the memory can be carried out more accurately when fully
general quantum measurements are used. Finally, as a transversal topic, I
propose an efficient algorithmic way of decomposing any quantum measurement
into convex combinations of simpler (extremal) measurements.

of the defining characteristics of intelligent behavior is the capacity to
learn from experience. However, a major bottleneck for agents to learn in any
real-life situation is the size and complexity of the corresponding task
environment. Owing to, e.g., a large space of possible strategies, learning is
typically slow. Even for a moderate task environment, it may simply take too
long to rationally respond to a given situation. If the environment is
impatient, allowing only a certain time for a response, an agent may then be
unable to cope with the situation and to learn at all. Here we show that
quantum physics can help and provide a significant speed-up for active learning
as a genuine problem of artificial intelligence. We introduce a large class of
quantum learning agents for which we show a quadratic boost in their active
learning efficiency over their classical analogues. This result will be
particularly relevant for applications involving complex task environments.

vexing problem that underlies a range of problems in experimental physics and
quantum information theory. Recently, a method called quantum Hamiltonian
learning has been proposed by the present authors that uses quantum simulation
as a resource for modeling an unknown quantum system. This approach can, under
certain circumstances, allow such models to be efficiently identified. A major
caveat of that work is the assumption of that all elements of the protocol are
noise-free. Here, we show that quantum Hamiltonian learning can tolerate
substantial amounts of depolarizing noise and show numerical evidence that it
can tolerate noise drawn from other realistic models. We further provide
evidence that the learning algorithm will find a model that is maximally close
to the true model in cases where the hypothetical model lacks terms present in
the true model. Finally, we also provide numerical evidence that the algorithm
works for non-commuting models. This work illustrates that quantum Hamiltonian
learning can be performed using realistic resources and suggests that even
imperfect quantum resources may be valuable for characterizing quantum systems.

possessing the certificate structure and such that a learning graph gives an
optimal quantum query algorithm for it.

bounded size, we construct a relatively general class of functions having this
property. The construction is based on orthogonal arrays, and generalizes the

considered. In particular, any problem with two-sided input can be transformed
into a single-input relational problem of equal classical one-way cost. We show
that the situation is different in the quantum case, where the same
transformation can make the communication complexity exponentially larger. This
happens if and only if the original problem has exponential gap between quantum
and classical one-way communication costs. We believe that these auxiliary
results might be of independent interest.

  Learning (FOCAL)","  The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) has been the
most successful Evolution Strategy at exploiting covariance information; it
uses a form of Principle Component Analysis which, under certain conditions, is
suggested to converge to the correct covariance matrix, formulated as the
inverse of the mathematically well-defined Hessian matrix. However, in
practice, there exist conditions where CMA-ES converges to the global optimum
(accomplishing its primary goal) while it does not learn the true covariance
matrix (missing an auxiliary objective), likely due to step-size deficiency.
These circumstances can involve high-dimensional landscapes with large
condition numbers. This paper introduces a novel technique entitled Forced
Optimal Covariance Adaptive Learning (FOCAL), with the explicit goal of
determining the Hessian at the global basin of attraction. It begins by
introducing theoretical foundations to the inverse relationship between the
learned covariance and the Hessian matrices. FOCAL is then introduced and
demonstrated to retrieve the Hessian matrix with high fidelity on both model
landscapes and experimental Quantum Control systems, which are observed to
possess a non-separable, non-quadratic search landscape. The recovered Hessian
forms are corroborated by physical knowledge of the systems. This study
constitutes an example for Natural Computing successfully serving other
branches of natural sciences, and introducing at the same time a powerful
generic method for any high-dimensional continuous search seeking landscape

quantum learning algorithms. We present techniques for derandomising algorithms
to decrease randomness resource requirements and improve efficiency. One key
object in doing this is a k-design, which is a distribution on the unitary
group whose kth moments match those of the unitarily invariant Haar measure. We
show that for a natural model of a random quantum circuit, the distribution of
random circuits quickly converges to a 2-design. We then present an efficient
unitary k-design construction for any k, provided the number of qubits n
satisfies k = O(n/log n). In doing this, we provide an efficient construction
of a quantum tensor product expander, which is a generalisation of a quantum
expander which in turn generalises classical expanders. We then discuss
applications of k-designs. We show that they can be used to improve the
efficiency of many existing algorithms and protocols and also find new
applications to derandomising large deviation bounds. In particular, we show
that many large deviation bound results for Haar random unitaries carry over to
k-designs for k = poly(n). In the second part of the thesis, we present some
learning and testing algorithms for the Clifford group. We find an optimal

applications such as voice and text recognition, image analysis, computer
diagnosis. The statistical set-up in classification is the following: we are
given an i.i.d. training set $(X_{1},Y_{1}),... (X_{n},Y_{n})$ where $X_{i}$
represents a feature and $Y_{i}\in \{0,1\}$ is a label attached to that
feature. The underlying joint distribution of $(X,Y)$ is unknown, but we can
learn about it from the training set and we aim at devising low error
classifiers $f:X\to Y$ used to predict the label of new incoming features.
  Here we solve a quantum analogue of this problem, namely the classification
of two arbitrary unknown qubit states. Given a number of `training' copies from
each of the states, we would like to `learn' about them by performing a
measurement on the training set. The outcome is then used to design mesurements
for the classification of future systems with unknown labels. We find the
asymptotically optimal classification strategy and show that typically, it
performs strictly better than a plug-in strategy based on state estimation.
  The figure of merit is the excess risk which is the difference between the
probability of error and the probability of error of the optimal measurement
when the states are known, that is the Helstrom measurement. We show that the
excess risk has rate $n^{-1}$ and compute the exact constant of the rate.

finite number of examples. The problem consists in finding the learning machine
that optimally emulates the examples, thus reproducing the unknown unitary
maximum fidelity. Learning a unitary is equivalent to storing it in the state
of a quantum memory (the memory of the learning machine), and subsequently
retrieving it. We prove that, whenever the unknown unitary is drawn from a
group, the optimal strategy consists in a parallel call of the available uses
followed by a ""measure-and-rotate"" retrieving. Differing from the case of
quantum cloning, where the incoherent ""measure-and-prepare"" strategies are
typically suboptimal, in the case of learning the ""measure-and-rotate"" strategy
is optimal even when the learning machine is asked to reproduce a single copy
of the unknown unitary. We finally address the problem of the optimal inversion
of an unknown unitary evolution, showing also in this case the optimality of
the ""measure-and-rotate"" strategies and applying our result to the optimal
approximate realignment of reference frames for quantum communication.

with the precision with which the sub-Poissonian tendency is confirmed in
higher photon number distribution of the source, rather than with actual
suppression of the multi-photon emission events. We present an example of the
secure key generation rate in the case of a poor SPS with $g^{(2)} = 0.19$, in
which no secure key is produced with the conventional QKD scheme, and show that

probabilistic environments are new representations and computation mechanisms.
In this paper, a novel quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method is proposed
by combining quantum theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by the
state superposition principle and quantum parallelism, a framework of value
updating algorithm is introduced. The state (action) in traditional RL is
identified as the eigen state (eigen action) in QRL. The state (action) set can
be represented with a quantum superposition state and the eigen state (eigen
action) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state
according to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The probability of
the eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is
parallelly updated according to rewards. Some related characteristics of QRL
such as convergence, optimality and balancing between exploration and
exploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good
tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude
and can speed up learning through the quantum parallelism. To evaluate the
performance and practicability of QRL, several simulated experiments are given
and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of QRL algorithm
for some complex problems. The present work is also an effective exploration on
the application of quantum computation to artificial intelligence.

function at the final time for both pure and mixed states. For pure states this

juntas, i.e. Boolean functions which depend only on an unknown set of k out of
n input variables. Our aim is to develop efficient algorithms:
  - whose sample complexity has no dependence on n, the dimension of the domain
the Boolean functions are defined over;
  - with no access to any classical or quantum membership (""black-box"")
queries. Instead, our algorithms use only classical examples generated
uniformly at random and fixed quantum superpositions of such classical
examples;
  - which require only a few quantum examples but possibly many classical
random examples (which are considered quite ""cheap"" relative to quantum
examples).
  Our quantum algorithms are based on a subroutine FS which enables sampling
according to the Fourier spectrum of f; the FS subroutine was used in earlier
work of Bshouty and Jackson on quantum learning. Our results are as follows:
  - We give an algorithm for testing k-juntas to accuracy $\epsilon$ that uses
$O(k/\epsilon)$ quantum examples. This improves on the number of examples used

that learn Boolean functions from quantum queries and quantum examples.
  Hunziker et al. conjectured that for any class C of Boolean functions, the
number of quantum black-box queries which are required to exactly identify an
unknown function from C is $O(\frac{\log |C|}{\sqrt{{\hat{\gamma}}^{C}}})$,
where $\hat{\gamma}^{C}$ is a combinatorial parameter of the class C. We
essentially resolve this conjecture in the affirmative by giving a quantum
algorithm that, for any class C, identifies any unknown function from C using
$O(\frac{\log |C| \log \log |C|}{\sqrt{{\hat{\gamma}}^{C}}})$ quantum black-box
queries.
  We consider a range of natural problems intermediate between the exact
learning problem (in which the learner must obtain all bits of information
about the black-box function) and the usual problem of computing a predicate
(in which the learner must obtain only one bit of information about the
black-box function). We give positive and negative results on when the quantum
and classical query complexities of these intermediate problems are
polynomially related to each other.
  Finally, we improve the known lower bounds on the number of quantum examples
(as opposed to quantum black-box queries) required for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC
learning any concept class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension d over the domain
$\{0,1\}^n$ from $\Omega(\frac{d}{n})$ to $\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log

unresolved issue is how to use the solutions found by these algorithms to learn
about the system's quantum dynamics. We propose a simple method based on

unitary ones can be useful in a quantum algorithm, our procedure requires only
one photon regardless of the size of the database, thereby establishing an

$\ket f^{\otimes N}$, $\ket{g_1}^{\otimes K}$, and $\ket{g_2}^{\otimes K}$, and
we want to decide which \textit{template} state $\ket{g_1}$ or $\ket{g_2}$,
each representing the feature of the pattern class ${\cal C}_1$ or ${\cal
C}_2$, respectively, is closest to the input \textit{feature} state $\ket f$.
This is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain.
Assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric
family of pure qubit systems, we derive two kinds of matching strategies. The
first is a semiclassical strategy which is obtained by the natural extension of
conventional matching strategies and consists of a two-stage procedure:
identification (estimation) of the unknown template states to design the
classifier (\textit{learning} process to train the classifier) and
classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on
the estimated results. The other is a fully quantum strategy without any
intermediate measurement which we might call as the {\it universal quantum
matching machine}. We present the Bayes optimal solutions for both strategies
in the case of K=1, showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum
matching procedure which is strictly superior to the straightforward
semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the
learning process.

deduced from interdependencies between simultaneously measured time series. We
apply two recently proposed interdependence measures which should give similar
results as cross predictabilities used by previous authors. The systems which
we study are asymmetrically coupled simple models (Lorenz, Roessler, and Henon
models), the couplings being such as to lead to generalized synchronization. If
the data were perfect (noisefree, infinitely long), we should be able to
detect, at least in some cases, which of the coupled systems is the driver and
which the response. This might no longer be true if the time series has finite
length. Instead, estimated interdependencies and mutual cross predictabilities
depend strongly on which of the systems has a higher effective dimension at the
typical neighborhood sizes used to estimate them, and causal relationships are
more difficult to detect. We also show that slightly different variants of the
interdependence measure can have quite different sensitivities.

methods from statistical mechanics is applied to the problem of generalization
in a perceptron with binary weights. The dynamics are solved for the case where
a new batch of training patterns is presented to each population member each
generation, which considerably simplifies the calculation. The theory is shown
to agree closely to simulations of a real GA averaged over many runs,
accurately predicting the mean best solution found. For weak selection and
large problem size the difference equations describing the dynamics can be
expressed analytically and we find that the effects of noise due to the finite
size of each training batch can be removed by increasing the population size
appropriately. If this population resizing is used, one can deduce the most
computationally efficient size of training batch each generation. For
independent patterns this choice also gives the minimum total number of
training patterns used. Although using independent patterns is a very
inefficient use of training patterns in general, this work may also prove
useful for determining the optimum batch size in the case where patterns are
recycled.

polynomially equivalent to the circuit model of quantum computing which implies
that quantum language models are richer than classical models unless BPP=BQP.
It also implies that, under certain circumstances, quantum Boltzmann machines
are more expressive than classical Boltzmann machines. Finally, we examine the
performance of our approach numerically for the case of classical harmonic
grammars and find that the method is capable of rapidly parsing even
non-trivial grammars. This suggests that the work may have value as a quantum
inspired algorithm beyond its initial motivation as a new quantum algorithm.

by \v{S}afr\'{a}nek et al. [Phys. Rev. A 99, 010101 (2019)] as a generalization
of Boltzmann entropy to quantum mechanics. This quantity can involve multiple
coarse-grainings, even those that do not commute with each other, without
losing any of its properties. It is well-defined out of equilibrium, and for
some coarse-grainings it generically rises to the correct thermodynamic value
even in a genuinely isolated quantum system. The quantity contains several
other entropy definitions as special cases, it has interesting
information-theoretic interpretations, and mathematical properties -- such as
extensivity and upper and lower bounds -- suitable for an entropy. Here we
describe and provide proofs for many of its properties, discuss its
interpretation and connection to other quantities, and provide numerous
simulations and analytic arguments supporting the claims of its relationship to
thermodynamic entropy. This quantity may thus provide a clear and well-defined
foundation on which to build a satisfactory understanding of the second
thermodynamical law in quantum mechanics.

salient ability to perform inference. Here, we introduce a quantum variational
autoencoder (QVAE): a VAE whose latent generative process is implemented as a
quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM). We show that our model can be trained
end-to-end by maximizing a well-defined loss-function: a 'quantum' lower-bound
to a variational approximation of the log-likelihood. We use quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) simulations to train and evaluate the performance of QVAEs. To
achieve the best performance, we first create a VAE platform with discrete
latent space generated by a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset when compared
against similar approaches that only involve discrete variables in the
generative process. We consider QVAEs with a smaller number of latent units to
be able to perform QMC simulations, which are computationally expensive. We
show that QVAEs can be trained effectively in regimes where quantum effects are
relevant despite training via the quantum bound. Our findings open the way to
the use of quantum computers to train QVAEs to achieve competitive performance
for generative models. Placing a QBM in the latent space of a VAE leverages the
full potential of current and next-generation quantum computers as sampling
devices.

field of quantum physics. In the nanokelvin regime, strongly correlated quantum
gases in optical lattices provide a clean and controllable platform for
studying complex many-body problems. However, the central challenge towards
revealing exotic phases of matter and creating robust multi-particle entangled
states is to further reduce the thermal entropy of such systems. Here we
realize efficient cooling of ten thousand ultracold bosons in staggered optical
lattices. By immersing Mott-insulator samples into removable superfluid
reservoirs, thermal entropy is extracted from the system. Losing only less than
half of the atoms, we lower the entropy of a Mott insulator by 65-fold,
achieving a record-low entropy per particle of 0.0019 $ k_{\text{B}}$
($k_{\text{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant). We further engineer the samples to
a defect-free array of isolated single atoms and successfully transfer it into
a coherent many-body state. The present staggered-immersion cooling opens up an
avenue for exploring novel quantum matters and promises practical applications
in quantum information science.

(GPE) simulations are compared to classical Boltzmann-Vlasov equation (BVE)

tunneling is then defined as the portion of the GPE transmission not described

height is observed in the purely classical simulation, suggesting that
observing such exponential dependence is not a sufficient condition for quantum
tunneling. Furthermore, the transmission is found to be predominately described
by classical effects, although interatomic interactions are shown to modify the
magnitude of the quantum tunneling. Interactions are also seen to affect the
amount of classical transmission, producing transmission in regions where the
non-interacting equivalent has none. This theoretical investigation clarifies
the contribution quantum tunneling makes to overall transmission in
many-particle interacting systems, potentially informing future tunneling

quantum-classical machine learning scheme to accomplish generative tasks.
However, whether PQCs have better expressive power than classical generative
neural networks, such as restricted or deep Boltzmann machines, remains an open
issue. In this paper, we prove that PQCs with a simple structure already
outperform any classical neural network for generative tasks, unless the
polynomial hierarchy collapses. Our proof builds on known results from tensor
networks and quantum circuits (in particular, instantaneous quantum polynomial
circuits). In addition, PQCs equipped with ancillary qubits for post-selection
have even stronger expressive power than those without post-selection. We
employ them as an application for Bayesian learning, since it is possible to
learn prior probabilities rather than assuming they are known. We expect that
it will find many more applications in semi-supervised learning where prior
distributions are normally assumed to be unknown. Lastly, we conduct several
numerical experiments using the Rigetti Forest platform to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed Bayesian quantum circuit.

equipartition theorem which states that for each degree of freedom the mean
kinetic energy $E_k$ equals $E_k=k_B T/2$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann
constant and $T$ is temperature of the system. Despite the fact that quantum
mechanics has already been developed for more than 100 years still there is no
quantum counterpart of this theorem. We attempt to fill this far-reaching gap
and consider the simplest system, i.e. the Caldeira-Leggett model for a free
quantum Brownian particle in contact with thermostat consisting of an infinite
number of harmonic oscillators. We prove that the mean kinetic energy $E_k$ of
the Brownian particle equals the mean kinetic energy $\langle \mathcal E_k
\rangle$ per one degree of freedom of the thermostat oscillators, i.e. $E_k =
\langle \mathcal E_k \rangle$. We show that this relation can be obtained from
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem derived within the linear response theory
and is universal in the sense that it holds true for any linear and non-linear
systems in contact with bosonic thermostat.

quantum annealing hardware (the D-Wave 2000Q), which includes the use of
forward and reverse annealing with an intermediate pause. This work provides
new insights into the inner workings of these devices (and quantum devices in
general), particular into how thermal effects govern the system dynamics. We
show that a pause mid-way through the anneal can cause a dramatic change in the
output distribution, and we provide evidence suggesting thermalization is
indeed occurring during such a pause. We demonstrate that upon pausing the
system in a narrow region shortly after the minimum gap, the probability of
successfully finding the ground state of the problem Hamiltonian can be
increased by several orders of magnitude. We relate this effect to relaxation
(i.e. thermalization) after diabatic and thermal excitations that occur in the
region near to the minimum gap. For a set of large-scale problems of up to 500
qubits, we demonstrate that the distribution returned from the annealer very
closely matches a (classical) Boltzmann distribution of the problem
Hamiltonian, albeit one with a temperature at least 1.5 times higher than the
(effective) temperature of the annealer. Moreover, we show that larger problems
are more likely to thermalize to a classical Boltzmann distribution.

equation for quantum gas mixtures with generalized differential cross-sections.
Spatially-homogeneous relaxation problems are used to demonstrate that the FSM
conserves mass and momentum/energy to the machine and spectral accuracy,
respectively. Based on the variational principle, transport coefficients such
as the shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion are calculated by
the FSM, which compare well with analytical solutions. Then, we apply the FSM
to find the accurate transport coefficients through an iterative scheme for the
linearized quantum Boltzmann equation. The shear viscosity and thermal
conductivity of the three-dimensional quantum Fermi and Bose gases interacting
through hard-sphere potential are calculated. For Fermi gas, the relative
difference between the accurate and variational transport coefficients
increases with the fugacity; for Bose gas, the relative difference in the
thermal conductivity has similar behavior as the gas moves from the classical
to the degenerate limits, but that in the shear viscosity decreases. Finally,
the shear viscosity and diffusion coefficient have also been calculated for a
two-dimensional equal-mole mixture of Fermi gases. When the molecular mass of
the two components are the same, our numerical results agree well with the
variational solution. However, when the molecular mass ratio is not one, large
discrepancies between the accurate and variational results are observed; our
results are reliable because (i) the method relies on no assumption and (ii)
the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy density satisfies the minimum
bound predicted by the string theory.

static entities. Alternate presentations of the smooth coarse-graining (fit)
for this discrete distribution compose probability-related evolving wave
function of the fields' dynamical modes. Their gauge modes, being symmetry
transformations, and constrained modes require no additional material
structure. We prove that evolution of any origin for which the quantum
superposition principle is absolute cannot be governed by specific laws. In
contrast, locally supersymmetric quantum fields that emerge as described from
the basic discrete distribution evolve by unchanging and closed physical laws.
The emergent quantum evolution is many-world; yet its Everett's branches whose
norm diminishes below a positive threshold cease to exist. Then some
experiments that for the standard Everett view would seem safe are instead
fatal for the participants. The Born rule arises dynamically in emergent
systems with extended regular past. It and, consequently, quasi-deterministic

not in typical random ones. This resolves the Boltzmann brain problem. We
explain how inflation creates new physical degrees of freedom around the Planck

yield a complete explanation for the Second Law of Thermodynamics (i.e., the
increase in entropy over time). The contribution of such a process would be to
provide a physical basis for the ontological indeterminacy needed to derive the
irreversible Second Law against a backdrop of otherwise reversible,
deterministic physical laws. An alternative understanding of the source of this
possible quantum ""collapse"" or non-unitarity is presented herein, in terms of
the Transactional Interpretation (TI). The present model provides a specific
physical justification for Boltzmann's often-criticized assumption of molecular
randomness (Stosszahlansatz), thereby changing its status from an ad hoc
postulate to a theoretically grounded result, without requiring any change to
the basic quantum theory. In addition, it is argued that TI provides an elegant
way of reconciling, via indeterministic collapse, the time-reversible Liouville
evolution with the time-irreversible evolution inherent in so-called ""master
equations"" that specify the changes in occupation of the various possible
states in terms of the transition rates between them. The present model is
contrasted with the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) ""spontaneous collapse"" theory

radiates coherent pairs of atoms with opposite momenta. We observe a matterwave

constituting the quantum Boltzmann distribution, $P^B_n \propto e^{-E_n/kT}$,
be derived from a requirement that the quantum configuration-space distribution
for a system in thermal equilibrium be very similar to the corresponding
classical distribution? It is certainly to be expected that the quantum
distribution in configuration space will approach the classical distribution as
the temperature approaches infinity, and a well-known equation derived from the
Boltzmann distribution shows that this is generically the case. Here we ask
whether one can reason in the opposite direction, that is, from
quantum-classical agreement to the Boltzmann probabilities. For two of the
simple examples we consider---a particle in a one-dimensional box and a simple
harmonic oscillator---this approach leads to probability distributions that
provably approach the Boltzmann probabilities at high temperature, in the sense
that the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions approaches zero.

probabilities of observing every possible state of a graph. As graph size
grows, the number of model states becomes intractably large and efficient
computation requires full sampling be replaced with heuristics and algorithms
that are only approximations of full sampling. This work investigates the
potential impact of adiabatic quantum computation for sampling purposes,
building on recent successes training Boltzmann machines using a quantum
device. We investigate the use case of quantum computation to train Boltzmann

  annealers","  By contrasting the performance of two quantum annealers operating at
different temperatures, we address recent questions related to the role of
temperature in these devices and their function as `Boltzmann samplers'. Using
a method to reliably calculate the degeneracies of the energy levels of
large-scale spin-glass instances, we are able to estimate the
instance-dependent effective temperature from the output of annealing runs. Our
results show that the output distributions of the annealers do not in general
correspond to classical Boltzmann distributions. For the small fraction of the
instances for which classical thermalization takes place, we find that the
effective temperatures are significantly higher than the physical temperatures.
Our results in this regime provide further evidence for the `freeze-out'
picture in which the output is sampled from equilibrium distributions
determined at a point in time earlier in the quantum annealing process. We also
find that the effective temperatures at different programming cycles fluctuate
greatly, with the effect worsening with problem size. We discuss the
implications of our results for the design of future quantum annealers to act
as efficient Boltzmann samplers and for the programming of such annealers.

have been the focus of much research. Quantum versions of functional
inequalities (like the modified logarithmic Sobolev and Poincar\'{e}
inequalities) and the so-called transportation cost inequalities, have proved
to be essential for this purpose. Classical functional and transportation cost
inequalities are seen to arise from a single geometric inequality, called the
Ricci lower bound, via an inequality which interpolates between them. The
latter is called the HWI-inequality, where the letters I, W and H are,
respectively, acronyms for the Fisher information (arising in the modified
logarithmic Sobolev inequality), the so-called Wasserstein distance (arising in
the transportation cost inequality) and the relative entropy (or Boltzmann H

the implications between them form a remarkable picture which relates elements
from diverse mathematical fields, such as Riemannian geometry, information
theory, optimal transport theory, Markov processes, concentration of measure,
and convexity theory. Here we consider a quantum version of the Ricci lower
bound introduced by Carlen and Maas, and prove that it implies a quantum HWI
inequality from which the quantum functional and transportation cost

quantum processing unit (QPU) to two classical Monte Carlo algorithms:
simulated annealing (SA) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). The study showed the
D-Wave 2X to be up to 100 million times faster than the classical algorithms.
The Google inputs are designed to demonstrate the value of collective
multiqubit tunneling, a resource available to D-Wave QPUs but not to simulated
annealing. But the computational hardness in these inputs is highly localized
in gadgets, with only a small amount of complexity coming from global
interactions, meaning that the relevance to real-world problems is limited.
  In this study we provide a new synthetic problem class that addresses the
limitations of the Google inputs while retaining their strengths. We use simple
clusters instead of more complex gadgets and more emphasis is placed on
creating computational hardness through frustrated global interactions like
those seen in interesting real-world inputs. The logical problems used to
generate these inputs can be solved in polynomial time [J. Phys. A, 15:10
(1982)]. However, for general heuristic algorithms that are unaware of the
planted problem class, the frustration creates meaningful difficulty in a
controlled environment ideal for study.
  We use these inputs to evaluate the new 2000-qubit D-Wave QPU. We include the
HFS algorithm---the best performer in a broader analysis of Google inputs---and
we include state-of-the-art GPU implementations of SA and QMC. The D-Wave QPU
solidly outperforms the software solvers: when we consider pure annealing time
(computation time), the D-Wave QPU reaches ground states up to 2600 times
faster than the competition. In the task of zero-temperature Boltzmann sampling
from challenging multimodal inputs, the D-Wave QPU holds a similar advantage as
quantum sampling bias does not seem significant.

sampling method applicable to discrete undirected graphical models. While
similar to simulated annealing, QA relies on quantum, rather than thermal,
effects to explore complex search spaces. For many classes of problems, QA is
known to offer computational advantages over simulated annealing. Here we
report on the ability of recent QA hardware to accelerate training of fully
visible Boltzmann machines. We characterize the sampling distribution of QA
hardware, and show that in many cases, the quantum distributions differ
significantly from classical Boltzmann distributions. In spite of this
difference, training (which seeks to match data and model statistics) using
standard classical gradient updates is still effective. We investigate the use
of QA for seeding Markov chains as an alternative to contrastive divergence
(CD) and persistent contrastive divergence (PCD). Using $k=50$ Gibbs steps, we
show that for problems with high-energy barriers between modes, QA-based seeds
can improve upon chains with CD and PCD initializations. For these hard
problems, QA gradient estimates are more accurate, and allow for faster
learning. Furthermore, and interestingly, even the case of raw QA samples (that
is, $k=0$) achieved similar improvements. We argue that this relates to the
fact that we are training a quantum rather than classical Boltzmann
distribution in this case. The learned parameters give rise to hardware QA
distributions closely approximating classical Boltzmann distributions that are
hard to train with CD/PCD.

  operator in the time dependent modelling of quantum transport","  In this work, the use of the Boltzmann collision operator for dissipative
quantum transport is analyzed. Its mathematical role on the description of the
time-evolution of the density matrix during a collision can be understood as
processes of adding and subtracting states. We show that unphysical results can
be present in quantum simulations when the old states (that built the density
matrix associated to an open system before the collision) are different from
the additional states generated by the Boltzmann collision operator. As a
consequence of the Fermi Golden rule, the new generated sates are usually
eigenstates of the momentum or kinetic energy. Then, the different
time-evolutions of old and new states involved in a collision process can
originate negative values of the charge density, even longer after the
collision. This unphysical feature disappears when the Boltzmann collision
operator generates states that were already present in the density matrix of
the quantum system before the collision. Following these ideas, in this paper,
we introduce an algorithm that models phonon-electron interactions through the
Boltzmann collision operator without negative values of the charge density. The
model only requires the exact knowledge, at all times, of the states that build
the density matrix of the open system.

of quantum and statistical physics, and inherent to such phenomena as thermal
radiation and van der Waals forces. While the basic principles are the material
of elementary texts, recent experimental and technological advances have made
it necessary to come to terms with counterintuitive consequences of
electromagnetic fluctuations at short scales -- in the so called {\it
near-field} regime. We focus on three manifestations of such behavior: {\bf
(i)} The Stefan--Boltzmann law describes thermal radiation from macroscopic
bodies, but fails to account for magnitude, polarization and coherence of
radiation from small objects (say compared to the skin depth). {\bf (ii)} The
heat transfer between two bodies at similar close proximity is dominated by
evanescent waves, and can be several orders of magnitude larger than the
classical contribution due to propagating waves. {\bf (iii)} Casimir/van der
Waals interactions are a dominant force between objects at sub-micron
separation; the non-equilibrium analogs of this force (for objects at different
temperatures) have not been sufficiently explored (at least experimentally). To
explore these phenomena we introduce the tool of fluctuational quantum
electrodynamics (QED) originally introduced by Rytov in the 1950s. Combined
with a scattering formalism, this enables studies of heat radiation and
transfer, equilibrium and non-equilibrium forces for objects of different

into a quiescent vacuum in which there are no dynamical quantum fluctuations.
Such fluctuations require either an evolving microstate, or time-dependent
histories of out-of-equilibrium recording devices, which we argue are absent in
stationary states. For a massive scalar field in a fixed de Sitter background,
the cosmic no-hair theorem implies that the state of the patch approaches the
vacuum, where there are no fluctuations. We argue that an analogous conclusion
holds whenever a patch of de Sitter is embedded in a larger theory with an
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, including semiclassical quantum gravity
with false vacua or complementarity in theories with at least one Minkowski
vacuum. This reasoning provides an escape from the Boltzmann brain problem in
such theories. It also implies that vacuum states do not uptunnel to
higher-energy vacua and that perturbations do not decohere while slow-roll
inflation occurs, suggesting that eternal inflation is much less common than
often supposed. On the other hand, if a de Sitter patch is a closed system with
a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there will be Poincare recurrences and
dynamical Boltzmann fluctuations into lower-entropy states. Our analysis does
not alter the conventional understanding of the origin of density fluctuations
from primordial inflation, since reheating naturally generates a high-entropy
environment and leads to decoherence, nor does it affect the existence of
non-dynamical vacuum fluctuations such as those that give rise to the Casimir
effect.

experience a quasistatic evolution, returning a final population that is close
to a Boltzmann distribution of the Hamiltonian at a single (freeze-out) point
during the annealing. Such a system is expected to correlate well with a proper
quantum Monte Carlo simulation. It may also correlate with simulated annealing
if at the freeze-out point the quantum energy eigenvalues are close to the
classical ones. These correlations are just signatures of equilibration and do
not mean that the evolution of the quantum annealer is classical or can be
simulated by quantum Monte Carlo. The computation time extracted from such a
distribution reflects the equilibrium behavior and therefore provides no
information about the underlying quantum dynamics. This makes the search for
quantum speedup in suboptimal quantum annealers problematic. We use an open
quantum master equation with realistic parameters to illustrate quasistatic
evolution in a 16 qubit quantum annealer and discuss its implication for
quantum speedup.

thermodynamical equilibrium? These questions are not new, dating even from the
very birth of quantum theory and have been the subject of a renewed interest
over the two last decades (see for instance the review in Eisert et al, Nature
Physics 2015). In this work, we propose a universal model demonstrating that
thermalisation of a small quantum system is an emergent property of the unitary
evolution under a Schr\""{o}dinger equation of a larger composite system, whose
initial state can be arbitrary. We show that the origin of universality lies in
the phenomenon of 'measure concentration', which provides self-averaging
properties for the reduced density matrix characterizing the state of the small
subsystem. Using our framework, we focus on the asymptotic state at long times
and consider its stationary properties. In typical macroscopic conditions, we
recover the canonical state and the Boltzmann distribution well known from
statistical thermodynamics. This findings lead us to propose an alternative and
more general definition of the canonical partition function which also allow us
to describe non thermal stationary states.

proceed from the strong coupling to the bath. Here, it is shown that these
deviations are related to the power spectrum of the bath. Specifically, it is
shown that the system thermal-equilibrium-state cannot be characterized by the
canonical Boltzmann's distribution in quantum mechanics. This is because the
uncertainty principle imposed a lower bound of the dispersion of the total
energy of the system that is dominated by the spectral density of the bath.
However, in the classical case, for a wide class of systems that interact via
central forces with pairwise-self-interacting environment, the system thermal
equilibrium state is exactly characterized by the canonical Boltzmann
distribution. As a consequence of this analysis and taking into account all
energy scales in the system and reservoir interaction, an effective coupling to
the environment is introduced. Sample computations in different regimes
predicted by this effective coupling are shown. Specifically, in the strong
coupling effective regime, the system exhibits deviations from standard
thermodynamics and in the weak coupling effective regime, quantum features such
as stationary entanglement are possible at high temperatures. Moreover, it is
known that the spectrum of thermal baths depends on the non-Markovian
character. Hence, non-Markovian interactions have a important role in the
thermal equilibrium state of physical systems. For example, in quantum
optomechanics is looked up to cool the mechanical system through an auxiliary
system which generally is a cavity. This cooling process takes into account the
non-Markovian interaction and as it is shown here, it is more effective than if
we use only the Markovian approximation in the equation of motion for the
different modes.

Fokker-Planck term gives TRPMD. We thereby provide error terms between TRPMD
and quantum dynamics and predict the systems in which they are likely to be
small. Using a harmonic analysis we show that careful addition of friction
causes the correct oscillation frequency of the higher ring-polymer normal
modes in a harmonic well, which we illustrate with calculation of the
position-squared autocorrelation function. However, no physical friction
parameter will produce the correct fluctuation dynamics for a parabolic
barrier. The results in this paper are consistent with previous numerical
studies and advise the use of TRPMD for the computation of spectra.

amenable to realization in controlled quantum platforms, such as ion-trap

  Fluctuations","  There are two kinds of quantum fluctuations relevant to cosmology that we
focus on in this article: those that form the seeds for structure formation in
the early universe and those giving rise to Boltzmann brains in the late
universe. First, structure formation requires slight inhomogeneities in the
density of matter in the early universe, which then get amplified by the effect
of gravity, leading to clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. According to
inflation theory, quantum fluctuations form the seeds of these inhomogeneities.
However, these quantum fluctuations are described by a quantum state which is
homogeneous and isotropic, and this raises a problem, connected to the
foundations of quantum theory, as the unitary evolution alone cannot break the
symmetry of the quantum state. Second, Boltzmann brains are random agglomerates
of particles that, by extreme coincidence, form functioning brains. Unlikely as
these coincidences are, they seem to be predicted to occur in a quantum
universe as vacuum fluctuations if the universe continues to exist for an
infinite (or just very long) time, in fact to occur over and over, even forming
the majority of all brains in the history of the universe. We provide a brief
introduction to the Bohmian version of quantum theory and explain why in this
version, Boltzmann brains, an undesirable kind of fluctuation, do not occur (or
at least not often), while inhomogeneous seeds for structure formation, a
desirable kind of fluctuation, do.

machines (DBMs) that uses rejection sampling in concert with variational
approximations to estimate the gradients of the training objective function.
Our algorithm is inspired by a recent quantum algorithm for training DBMs. We
obtain rigorous bounds on the errors in the approximate gradients; in turn, we
find that choosing the instrumental distribution to minimize the alpha=2
divergence with the Gibbs state minimizes the asymptotic algorithmic
complexity. Our rejection sampling approach can yield more accurate gradients
than low-order contrastive divergence training and the costs incurred in
finding increasingly accurate gradients can be easily parallelized. Finally our

method is then extended to the Dirac equation in curved spaces and it is
demonstrated that the quantum walk structure is preserved. Finally, it is

statistical distribution formulas if there is a universal limitation for the
size of energetic quantum leaps (magnitude of quantum leaps smaller than Planck
energy). By means of a restriction of the a priori equiprobability postulate
one can reach a thermodynamic foundation of these corrected distribution
formulas. The number of microstates is determined by means of a suitable
counting method and combined with thermodynamics via the Boltzmann principle.
The result is that, for particle energies that come close to the Planck energy,
the thermodynamic difference between fermion and boson distribution vanishes.
Both distributions then approximate a Boltzmann distribution. The wave and
particle character of the quantum particles, too, can be influenced by choosing
the size of the temperature and particle energy parameters relative to the
Planck energy, as you can see from the associated fluctuation formulas. In the
case of non-relativistic degeneration, the critical parameters Fermi momentum
(fermions) and Einstein temperature (bosons) vanish as soon as the rest energy
of the quantum particles reaches the Planck energy. For the Bose-Einstein
condensation there exists, in the condensation range, a finite upper limit for
the number of particles in the ground state, which is determined by the ratio
of Planck mass to the rest mass of the quantum particles. In the relativistic
high-temperature range, the energy densities of photon and neutrino radiation
have finite limit values, which is of interest with regard to the start of
cosmic expansion.

formulated. The mathematical and physical relevance of the radix economy, also
called digit capacity, is established, showing how physical laws can be derived
from this concept in a unified way. The principle reinterprets and generalizes
the principle of least action yielding two classes of physical solutions: least
action paths and quantum wavefunctions. A new physical foundation of the
Hilbert space of quantum mechanics is then accomplished and it is used to
derive the Schr\""odinger and Dirac equations and the breaking of the
commutativity of spacetime geometry. The formulation provides an explanation of
how determinism and random statistical behavior coexist in spacetime and a
framework is developed that allows dynamical processes to be formulated in
terms of chains of digits. These methods lead to a new (pre-geometrical)
foundation for Lorentz transformations and special relativity. The
Parker-Rhodes combinatorial hierarchy is encompassed within our approach and
this leads to an estimate of the interaction strength of the electromagnetic
and gravitational forces that agrees with the experimental values to an error
of less than one thousandth. Finally, it is shown how the principle of

dynamics of a quantum dot modelled as a cascade three-level system. We show
that the phonon bath appears to the upper transition of the cascade system as a
broadband reservoir of inverted rather than conventional harmonic oscillators.
The action of the annihilation and creation operators of the inverted
oscillator are interchanges relative to those of the usual harmonic oscillator
that it serves as a linear amplifier to the system, and thereby gives rise to
unusual features in the dynamics of the quantum dot. We find that the phonon
bath, although being in a thermal state, affects the quantum dot as a
correlated-type reservoir which results in the decay of the system to a
correlated two-photon state with the population distribution no longer obeying
a Boltzmann distribution. It is particularly interesting that even for a zero
temperature phonon reservoir the steady state is a correlated state which under
appropriate conditions on the Rabi frequencies and the damping rates can reduce
to a strongly correlated pure state. It is shown that the two-photon
correlations result in a significant squeezing and strong two-photon
correlations in the radiation field emitted by the quantum dot. The presence of
the correlations in the system is manifest in the presence of quantum beats in

quantum systems: (i) Casimir forces between parallel plates that conduct along
different directions, and (ii) a topological Aharonov-Bohm (AB) type force
between fluxons in a superconductor. As we illustrate, standard path integral
calculations suggest that thermal effects may remove the angular dependence of
the Casimir force in case (i) with a decoherence time set by h/(k_{B} T) where
h is Plank's constant and k_{B} is the Boltzmann constant. This prediction may
be tested. The effect in case (ii) is due a phase shift picked by unpaired
electrons upon encircling an odd number of fluxons. In principle, this effect
may lead to small modifications in Abrikosov lattices. While the AB forces
exist at extremely low temperatures, we find that thermal decoherence may
strongly suppress the topological force at experimentally pertinent finite
temperatures. It is suggested that both cases (i) and (ii) (as well as other
examples briefly sketched) are related to a quantum version of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

""nonequilibrium subspace"", any initial state (from the energy shell)
thermalizes, and in fact does so very quickly, on the order of the Boltzmann
time $\tau__\mathrm{B}:=h/(k_\mathrm{B}T)$. This apparently unrealistic, but
mathematically rigorous, conclusion has the important physical implication that
the moderately slow decay observed in reality is not typical in the present
setting.
  The fact that macroscopic systems approach thermal equilibrium may seem
puzzling, for example, because it may seem to conflict with the
time-reversibility of the microscopic dynamics. According the present result,
what needs to be explained is, not that macroscopic systems approach

  of Quantum Information Theory","  The following issues are discussed inspired by the recent paper of Kadanoff
(arXiv: 1403:6162): (a) Construction of a generalized one-particle Wigner
distribution (GWD) function (analog of the classical distribution function)
from which the quantum kinetic equation due to Kadanoff and Baym (KB) is
derived, often called the Quantum Boltzmann Equation (QBE); (b) The equation
obeyed by this has a collision contribution in the form of a two-particle Green
function. This term is manipulated to have Kinetic Entropy in parallel to its
counterpart in the classical Boltzmann kinetic equation for the classical
distribution function. This proved to be problematic in that unlike in the
classical Boltzmann kinetic equation, the contribution from the kinetic entropy
term was non-positive; (3) Kadanoff surmised that this situation could perhaps
be related to quantum entanglement that may not have been included in his
theory. It is shown that GWD is not positive everywhere (indicating dynamical
quantumness) just like the commonly recognized property of the Wigner function
(negative property indicating quantumness of the state). The issue of
non-positive feature appearing in approximate evaluation of patently positive
entities in many particle systems is here pointed to an early discussion of
this issue (Phys. Rev. A10, 1852 (1974)) in terms of a theorem on truncation of
cumulant expansion of a probability distribution function due to Marcinkeiwicz.
The last issue of presence or absence of entanglement in an approximate
evaluation of a many particle correlation poses a new problem; it is considered
here in terms of fermionic entanglement theory in the light of density matrix

  Calculations of Reduced Equilibrium Density Matrices of Open Multilevel
  Quantum Systems","  Understanding the roles of the temporary and spatial structures of quantum
functional noise in open multilevel quantum molecular systems attracts a lot of
theoretical interests. I want to establish a rigorous and general framework for
functional quantum noises from the constructive and computational perspectives,
$\it{i.e.}$ how to generate the random trajectories to reproduce the kernel and
path ordering of the influence functional with effective Monte Carlo methods
for arbitrary spectral densities. This construction approach aims to unify the
existing stochastic models to rigorously describe the temporary and spatial
structure of Gaussian quantum noises. In this paper, I review the Euclidean
imaginary time influence functional and propose the stochastic matrix
multiplication scheme to calculate reduced equilibrium density matrices (REDM).
  In addition, I review and discuss the Feynman-Vernom influence functional
according to the Gaussian quadratic integral, particularly its imaginary part
which is critical to the rigorous description of the quantum detailed balance.
As a result, I establish the conditions under which the influence functional
can be interpreted as the average of exponential functional operator over
real-valued Gaussian processes for open multilevel quantum systems. I also show
the difference between the local and nonlocal phonons within this framework.
With the stochastic matrix multiplication scheme, I compare the normalized REDM
with the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution for open multilevel quantum
systems.

thoughts about one of Turing's obsessions throughout his life, the question of
physics and free will. I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call
""Knightian freedom"": a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability
that goes beyond probabilistic unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical
aspects of free will I regard as possibly outside the scope of science. I
examine a viewpoint, suggested independently by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and
even Turing himself, that tries to find scope for ""freedom"" in the universe's
boundary conditions rather than in the dynamical laws. Taking this viewpoint
seriously leads to many interesting conceptual problems. I investigate how far
one can go toward solving those problems, and along the way, encounter (among
other things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement problem, decoherence,
chaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb's paradox,
Boltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior
Assumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored here to the more radical
speculations of Roger Penrose. The result of all this is an unusual perspective
on time, quantum mechanics, and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical,
but which has several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests
interesting empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and
takes a millennia-old philosophical debate into some underexplored territory.

previous derivations of kinetic equations that rely on similar physical
assumptions, but obtain approximate equations of motion from a gradient
expansion in momentum space. We show that the system follows a generalized

Boltzmann equation, which includes off-shell transport, is valid far from

  regime","  In this work we investigate the late-time stationary states of open quantum
systems coupled to a thermal reservoir in the strong coupling regime. In
general such systems do not necessarily relax to a Boltzmann distribution if
the coupling to the thermal reservoir is non-vanishing or equivalently if the
relaxation timescales are finite. Using a variety of non-equilibrium formalisms
valid for non-Markovian processes, we show that starting from a product state
of the closed system = system + environment, with the environment in its
thermal state, the open system which results from coarse graining the
environment will evolve towards an equilibrium state at late-times. This state
can be expressed as the reduced state of the closed system thermal state at the
temperature of the environment. For a linear (harmonic) system and environment,
which is exactly solvable, we are able to show in a rigorous way that all
multi-time correlations of the open system evolve towards those of the closed
system thermal state. Multi-time correlations are especially relevant in the
non-Markovian regime, since they cannot be generated by the dynamics of the
single-time correlations. For more general systems, which cannot be exactly
solved, we are able to provide a general proof that all single-time
correlations of the open system evolve to those of the closed system thermal
state, to first order in the relaxation rates. For the special case of a
zero-temperature reservoir, we are able to explicitly construct the reduced
closed system thermal state in terms of the environmental correlations.

no upper bound. Thus arbitrarily large positive energy density fluctuations are
possible. We are not able to give closed form expressions for the probability
distribution, but rather use calculations of a finite number of moments to
estimate the lower bounds, the asymptotic forms for large positive argument,
and possible fits to the intermediate region. The first 65 moments are used for
these purposes. All of our results are subject to the caveat that these
distributions are not uniquely determined by the moments. However, we also give
bounds on the cumulative distribution function that are valid for any
distribution fitting these moments.We apply the asymptotic form of the
electromagnetic energy density distribution to estimate the nucleation rates of
black holes and of Boltzmann brains.

tool for systemizing the contributions of higher order correlation functions to
the dynamics of lower order correlation functions. Together with the large N

whereby an H-theorem is obtained, which can be viewed as a signifier of the
emergence of macroscopic behavior in the system. We give two more examples from
past work: 2) the nonequilibrium dynamics of N atoms in an optical lattice
under the large $\cal N$ (field components), 2PI and second order perturbative
expansions, illustrating how N and $\cal N$ enter in these three aspects of
quantum correlations, coherence and coupling strength. 3) the behavior of an
interacting quantum system near its critical point, the effects of quantum and
thermal fluctuations and the conditions under which the system manifests
infrared dimensional reduction. We also discuss how the effective field theory

a bath characterized by inverse temperature $\beta$ and chemical potential

describes in a non-perturbative fashion, by means of scattering theory, how the
quantum motion of a single test particle is affected by collisions with an
ideal background gas. A heuristic derivation of this Lindblad master equation
is presented, based on the requirement of translation-covariance and on the
relation to the classical linear Boltzmann equation. After analyzing its
general symmetry properties and the associated relaxation dynamics, we discuss
a quantum Monte Carlo method for its numerical solution. We then review
important limiting forms of the quantum linear Boltzmann equation, such as the
case of quantum Brownian motion and pure collisional decoherence, as well as
the application to matter wave optics. Finally, we point to the incorporation
of quantum degeneracies and self-interactions in the gas by relating the
equation to the dynamic structure factor of the ambient medium, and we provide
an extension of the equation to include internal degrees of freedom.

harmonic coupling, evolves such that any small subsystem n<<N of the global
state approaches equilibrium. This provides a novel example where equilibration
emerges as a natural phenomena under quantum dynamics alone, with no necessity
to bring in any additional statistical postulates. Mixedness of equilibrated
subsystems consisting of 1, 2, ....., n<<N clearly indicates that small
subsystems are entangled with the rest of the state i.e., the bath. Every
single mode oscillator is found to relax in a mixed density matrix of the
Boltzmann canonical form. In two oscillator equilibrated subsystems,
intra-entanglement within the `system' oscillators is found to exist when the
magnitude of the squeezing parameter of the bath is comparable in magnitude
with that of the coupling strength.

levels in a large isolated quantum system, where all possible superpositions of
eigenstates are allowed, provided all these superpositions have the same fixed
energy. Such a condition is not equivalent to the conventional micro-canonical
condition, because the latter limits the participating eigenstates to a very
narrow energy window. The statistics is obtained analytically for both the
entire system and its small subsystem. In a significant departure from the
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, the average occupation numbers of quantum states
exhibit in the present case weak algebraic dependence on energy. In the
macroscopic limit, this dependence is routinely accompanied by the condensation
into the lowest energy quantum state. This work contains initial numerical
tests of the above statistics for finite systems, and also reports the
following numerical finding: When the basis states of large but finite random
matrix Hamiltonians are expanded in terms of eigenstates, the participation of
eigenstates in such an expansion obeys the newly obtained statistics. The above
statistics might be observable in small quantum systems, but for the
macroscopic systems, it rather reenforces doubts about self-sufficiency of

sufficiently smooth interactions, the Wigner-Kirkwood formalism provides a
semiclassical expansion of the Boltzmann density in configuration space in even
powers of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$. This result permits one
to generate an analogous $\lambda$-expansion for the bulk free energy and
many-body densities. The present paper brings a technically nontrivial
generalization of the Wigner-Kirkwood technique to semi-infinite quantum
fluids, constrained by a plane hard wall impenetrable to particles. In contrast
to the bulk case, the resulting Boltzmann density involves also
position-dependent terms of type $\exp(-2x^2/\lambda^2)$ ($x$ denotes the
distance from the wall boundary) which are non-analytic in $\lambda$. Under
some condition, the analyticity in $\lambda$ is restored by integrating the
Boltzmann density over configuration space; however, in contrast to the bulk
free energy, the semiclassical expansion of the surface part of the free energy
(surface tension) contains odd powers of $\lambda$, too. Explicit expressions
for the leading quantum corrections in the presence of the boundary are given
for the one-body and two-body densities. As model systems for explicit
calculations, we use Coulomb fluids, in particular the one-component plasma
defined in the $\nu$-dimensional (integer $\nu\ge 2$) space.

necessity of possessing reasonably good (variational) trial wavefunctions, as
the key point of the algorithm. We have considered two possible classes of
trial wavefunctions, a mean-field single-site one -- whose optimization is
however a very difficult task -- and a Boltzmann-like choice. We performed
GFMC-QA runs using such a Boltzmann-like trial wavefunction, finding results
for the residual energies that are qualitatively similar to those of CA (but at
a much larger computational cost), and definitely worse than PIMC-QA. We
conclude that, at present, without a serious effort in constructing reliable
importance sampling variational wavefunctions for a quantum glass, GFMC-QA is
not a true competitor of PIMC-QA.

particle interacting with a dilute and in general non-equilibrium gaseous
environment in the low density limit is outlined. The low density limit is the
kinetic Markovian regime when only pair collisions (i.e., collisions of the
test particle with one particle of the gas at one time moment) contribute to
the dynamics. In the white noise approach one first proves that the appropriate
operators describing the gas converge in the sense of appropriate matrix
elements to certain operators of quantum white noise. Then these white noise
operators are used to derive quantum white noise and quantum stochastic
equations describing the approximate dynamics of the total system consisting of
the particle and the gas. The derivation is given ab initio, starting from the
exact microscopic quantum dynamics. The limiting dynamics is described by a
quantum stochastic equation driven by a quantum Poisson process. This equation
then applied to the derivation of quantum Langevin equation and linear

to a deterministic reality before the roles were reversed by the quantum
revolution (under the leadership of Heisenberg and Dirac) whereby it was the
deterministic description that was reduced to the status of an approximation,
while the role of the observer became particularly prominent. The concomitant
problem of lack of objectivity in the original Copenhagen interpretation has
not been satisfactorily resolved in newer approaches of the kind pioneered by
Everett. The deficiency of such interpretations is attributable to failure to
allow for the anthropic aspect of the problem, meaning {\it a priori}
uncertainty about the identity of the observer. The required reconciliation of
subjectivity with objectivity is achieved here by distinguishing the concept of
an observer from that of a perceptor, whose chances of identification with a
particular observer need to be prescribed by a suitable anthropic principle. It
is proposed that this should be done by an entropy ansatz according to which
the relevant micro-anthropic weighting is taken to be proportional to the

especial time coordinate that is different from the usual time parameter

in the classical case to the Boltzmann entropy. It is tempting to regard the
Von Neumann entropy as the corresponding quantum mechanical definition. But the
latter is problematic from quantum information point of view. Consequently we
introduce a new definition of entropy that reflects the inherent uncertainty of
quantum mechanical states. We derive for it an explicit expression, and discuss
some of its general properties. We distinguish between the minimum uncertainty
entropy of pure states, and the excess statistical entropy of mixtures.

statistical theory if one inverts the velocities of all particles, so that, due
to the reversibility of Newton's equations, they return from the equilibrium to
a nonequilibrium initial state. Boltzmann only replied ``then go and invert
them''. This problem of the relationship between the microscopic and
macroscopic descriptions of the physical world and time-reversibility has been
hotly debated from the XIXth century up to nowadays. At present, no modern
computer is able to perform Boltzmann's demand for a macroscopic number of
particles. In addition, dynamical chaos implies exponential growth of any
imprecision in the inversion that leads to practical irreversibility. Here we
show that a quantum computer composed of a few tens of qubits, and operating
even with moderate precision, can perform Boltzmann's demand for a macroscopic
number of classical particles. Thus, even in the regime of dynamical chaos, a
realistic quantum computer allows to rebuild a specific initial distribution
from a macroscopic state given by thermodynamic laws.

surface of the torus, the rate is determined by diffusive motion of vortices
around the torus and does not depend exponentially on the linear size; we find,
however, that when the two dimensions of the torus are comparable the rate does

equations reduce to the single Boltzmann equation for particle density, in
which particles flow along modified semiclassical trajectories in phase space.

This method is an extension of the works by Bogoliubov, van Hove and Prigogine
and it permits to study not only the system but also the reservoir degrees of
freedom. We consider the stochastic limit of translation invariant Hamiltonians
in quantum field theory and show that the master field satisfies a new type of
commutation relations, the so called entangled (or interacting) commutation
relations. These relations extend the interacting Fock relations established
earlier in non-relativistic QED and the free (or Boltzmann) commutation
relations which have been found in the large N limit of QCD. As an application
of the stochastic limit method we consider the photon splitting cascades in
magnetic field and show that photons in cascades form entangled states
(""triphons"") and they obey not Bose but a new type of statistics corresponding
to the entangled commutation relations.

properties of interacting quantum fields, and in providing a field theoretical
justification for a stochastic source term in the Boltzmann equation. We start
with the formulation of quantum field theory in terms of the Schwinger - Dyson
equations for the correlation functions, which we describe by a
closed-time-path master ($n = \infty PI$) effective action. When the hierarchy
is truncated, one obtains the ordinary closed-system of correlation functions
up to a certain order, and from the nPI effective action, a set of
time-reversal invariant equations of motion. But when the effect of the higher
order correlation functions is included (through e.g., causal factorization--
molecular chaos -- conditions, which we call 'slaving'), in the form of a
correlation noise, the dynamics of the lower order correlations shows
dissipative features, as familiar in the field-theory version of Boltzmann
equation. We show that fluctuation-dissipation relations exist for such
effectively open systems, and use them to show that such a stochastic term,
which explicitly introduces quantum fluctuations on the lower order correlation
functions, necessarily accompanies the dissipative term, thus leading to a
Boltzmann-Langevin equation which depicts both the dissipative and stochastic
dynamics of correlation functions in quantum field theory.

model of a particle interacting with a harmonic oscillator bath. Our goal is to
understand the effects of non-Markovian processes on the relaxational dynamics
and to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with
approximate Markovian and Non-Markovian quantum kinetics. There are two
different cases that are studied in detail: i) a quasiparticle (resonance) when
the renormalized frequency of the particle is above the frequency threshold of
the bath and ii) a stable renormalized `particle' state below this threshold.
The time evolution of the occupation number for the particle is evaluated
exactly using different approaches that yield to complementary insights. The
exact solution allows us to investigate the concept of the formation time of a
quasiparticle and to study the difference between the relaxation of the
distribution of bare particles and that of quasiparticles. We derive a
non-Markovian quantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and
includes off-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell
contributions and the usual Boltzmann equation (energy conserving) are obtained
from the quantum kinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time
scales upon different coarse-graining assumptions. The relaxational dynamics
predicted by the non-Markovian, Markovian and Boltzmann approximations are
compared to the exact result. The Boltzmann approach is seen to fail in the
case of wide resonances and when threshold and renormalization effects are
important.

equation. We calculate the drag rate for experimentally relevant parameters,
and show that for moderately high temperatures ($T\gtrsim 0.2 T_F$, where $T_F$

a large enhancement of the drag rate due to the presence of coupled plasmon

as a function of temperature at $T \approx 0.5 T_F$, and (ii) as a function of
the ratio of densities of the carriers in the two layers when their Fermi
velocities are equal. We also show that the drag rate can be significantly

fundamental importance of time scales: only if the various time scales
exhibited by the dynamics are widely disparate, can the evolution of the slower
degrees of freedom be described by a conventional Markovian transport equation;
otherwise, one must account for finite memory effects. We show how the
projection method can be employed to determine these time scales, and how --if
necessary-- it allows one to include memory effects in a straightforward
manner. Finally, there is an appendix in which we discuss the concepts of
entropy and macroscopic irreversibility.

Fermi-liquid behaviors of the density-density and the current-current

specific initial state will approach thermal equilibrium if the energy
eigenfunctions which are superposed to form that state obey {\it Berry's
conjecture}. Berry's conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding
classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy
eigenfunctions behave as if they were gaussian random variables. We review the
existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially
strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas
as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically
chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture
predicts a Maxwell--Boltzmann, Bose--Einstein, or Fermi--Dirac distribution for
the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave
functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely
antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this
phenomenon {\it eigenstate thermalization}. We show that a generic initial
state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as
$O(\hbar/\Delta)t^{-1}$, where $\Delta$ is the uncertainty in the total energy
of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to
the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is
needed. We argue that these results constitute a new foundation for quantum
statistical mechanics.

  resource in molecular recognition","  Quantum tunneling events occurring through biochemical bonds are capable to
generate quantum correlations between bonded systems, which in turn makes the
conventional second law of thermodynamics approach insufficient to investigate
these systems. This means that the utilization of these correlations in their
biological functions could give an evolutionary advantage to biomolecules to an
extent beyond the predictions of molecular biology that are generally based on
the second law in its standard form. To explore this possibility, we first
compare the tunneling assisted quantum entanglement shared in the ground states
of covalent and hydrogen bonds. Only the latter appears to be useful from a
quantum information point of view. Also, significant amounts of quantum
entanglement can be found in the thermal state of hydrogen bond. Then, we focus
on an illustrative example of ligand binding in which a receptor protein or an
enzyme is restricted to recognize its ligands using the same set of
proton-acceptors and donors residing on its binding site. In particular, we
show that such a biomolecule can discriminate between $3^n - 1$ agonist ligands
if it uses the entanglement shared in $n$ intermolecular hydrogen bonds as a
resource in molecular recognition. Finally, we consider the molecular
recognition events encountered in both the contemporary genetic machinery and
its hypothetical primordial ancestor in pre-DNA world, and discuss whether
there may have been a place for the utilization of quantum entanglement in the

Samplers, poses a major challenge for any research program that aims to show
quantum advantages over classical hardware. To address this problem, we propose
a novel data-driven approach wherein models are trained to identify common
pathologies using unsupervised machine learning methods. We illustrate this
idea by training a classifier that exploits K-means clustering to distinguish
between Boson Samplers that use indistinguishable photons from those that do
not. We train the model on numerical simulations of small-scale Boson Samplers
and then validate the pattern recognition technique on larger numerical
simulations as well as on photonic chips in both traditional Boson Sampling and
scattershot experiments. The effectiveness of such method relies on
particle-type-dependent internal correlations present in the output
distributions. This approach performs substantially better on the test data
than previous methods and underscores the ability to further generalize its
operation beyond the scope of the examples that it was trained on.

  capacities in quantum brain networks: Lesson from black holes","  We implement a mechanism - originally proposed as a model for the large
memory storage capacity of black holes - in quantum neural networks and show
that an exponentially increased capacity of pattern storage and recognition is
achieved in certain critically excited states, without involvement of synaptic
plasticity. We consider a simple network of N interconnected quantum neurons
with weak excitatory synaptic connections. We show that for frozen synaptic
weights there exist the critical states of enhanced memory storage capacity.
These states are achieved thanks to the high excitation levels of some of the
neurons, which - despite of feeble synaptic connections - dramatically lower
the response threshold of the remaining weaker-excited neurons. As a results,
the latter neurons acquire a capacity to store an exponentially large number of
patterns within a narrow energy gap. The stored patterns can be recognized and
retrieved with perfect response under the influence of arbitrarily soft input
stimuli. In sharp contrast, under the same stimuli the recall is absent in the
ground-state of the system. The lesson is that the state with the highest
micro-state entropy and memory storage capacity is not necessarily a local
minimum of energy, but rather an excited critical state. The considered
phenomenon has a smooth classical limit and can serve for achieving an enhanced

  species in quantum-like modeling of evolution","  A review of the mechanisms of speciation is performed. The mechanisms of the
evolution of species, taking into account the feedback of the state of the
environment and mechanisms of the emergence of complexity, are considered. It
is shown that these mechanisms, at the molecular level, cannot work steadily in
terms of classical mechanics. Quantum mechanisms of changes in the genome,
based on the long-range interaction potential between biologically important
molecules, are proposed as one of possible explanation. Different variants of
interactions of the organism and environment based on molecular recognition and
leading to new species origins are considered. Experiments to verify the model
are proposed. This bio-physical study is completed by the general operational
model of based on quantum information theory. The latter is applied to model

of chiral odorants based on the odorant-mediated electron transport from a
donor to an acceptor of the olfactory receptors embodied in a biological
environment. The chiral odorant is effectively described by an asymmetric
double-well potential whose minima are associated to the left- and right-handed
enantiomers. The introduced asymmetry is considered as an overall measure of
chiral interactions. The biological environment is conveniently modeled as a
bath of harmonic oscillators. The resulting Spin-Boson model is adapted by a
polaron transformation to derive the corresponding Born-Markov master equation
with which we obtain the elastic and inelastic electron tunneling rates. We
show that the inelastic tunneling through left- and right-handed enantiomers
occurs with different rates. The discrimination mechanism depends on the ratio
of tunneling frequency to localization frequency.

Kolmogorov's axioms. We show that such a scenario accommodates many important
examples, and in particular, we provide a rigorous definition of the classical
and the quantum pattern recognition problems, respectively. Our framework
allows for the introduction of non-trivial correlations (as entanglement or
discord) between the different species involved, opening the door to a new way
of harnessing these physical resources for solving pattern recognition
problems. Finally, we present some examples and discuss the computational
complexity of the quantum pattern recognition problem, showing that the most
important quantum computation algorithms can be described as non-Kolmogorovian
pattern recognition problems.

affine automata. In particular, we show that an infinite family of unary
regular languages can be recognized by 2-state affine automata but the state
numbers of quantum and probabilistic automata cannot be bounded. Finally, we
present the characterization of all (regular) unary languages recognized by

  for recognition of ambiguous figures","  We interpret the Leggett-Garg (LG) inequality as a kind of contextual
probabilistic inequality in which one combines data collected in experiments
performed for three different contexts. In the original version of the
inequality these contexts have the temporal nature and they are given by three
pairs of instances of time, $(t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), (t_3, t_4),$ where $t_1 <
t_2 < t_3.$ We generalize LG conditions of macroscopic realism and noninvasive
measurability in the general contextual framework. Our formulation is done in
the purely probabilistic terms: existence of the context independent joint
probability distribution $P$ and the possibility to reconstruct the
experimentally found marginal (two dimensional) probability distributions from
the $P.$ We derive an analog of the LG inequality, ""contextual LG inequality"",
and use it as a test of ""quantum-likeness"" of statistical data collected in a
series of experiments on recognition of ambiguous figures. In our experimental
study the figure under recognition is the Schroeder stair which is shown with
rotations for different angles. Contexts are encoded by dynamics of rotations:
clockwise, anticlockwise, and random. Our data demonstrated violation of the
contextual LG inequality for some combinations of aforementioned contexts.
Since in quantum theory and experiments with quantum physical systems this
inequality is violated, e.g., in the form of the original LG-inequality, our
result can be interpreted as a sign that the quantum(-like) models can provide
a more adequate description of the data generated in the process of recognition
of ambiguous figures.

  languages","  We show that there are quantum devices that accept all regular languages and
that are exponentially more concise than deterministic finite automata (DFA).
For this purpose, we introduce a new computing model of {\it one-way quantum
finite automata} (1QFA), namely, {\it one-way quantum finite automata together
with classical states} (1QFAC), which extends naturally both measure-only 1QFA
and DFA and whose state complexity is upper-bounded by both. The original
contributions of the paper are the following. First, we show that the set of
languages accepted by 1QFAC with bounded error consists precisely of all
regular languages. Second, we prove that 1QFAC are at most exponentially more
concise than DFA. Third, we show that the previous bound is tight for families
of regular languages that are not recognized by measure-once (RMO),
measure-many (RMM) and multi-letter 1QFA. % More concretely we exhibit regular
languages $L^0(m)$ for $m$ prime such that: (i) $L^0(m)$ cannot be recognized
by measure-once, measure-many and multi-letter 1QFA; (ii) the minimal DFA that
accepts $L^0(m)$ has $O(m)$ states; (iii) there is a 1QFAC with constant
classical states and $O(\log(m))$ quantum basis that accepts $L^0(m)$. Fourth,
we give a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether any two 1QFAC are
equivalent. Finally, we show that state minimization of 1QFAC is decidable

  Phenomenon","  Preoccupied with measurement, physics has neglected the need, before anything
can be measured, to recognize what it is that is to be measured. The
recognition of symbols employs a known physical mechanism. The elemental
mechanism-a damped inverted pendulum joined by a driven adjustable pendulum (in
effect a clock)-both recognizes a binary distinction and records a single bit.
Referred to by engineers as a ""clocked flip-flop,"" this paired-pendulum
mechanism pervades scientific investigation. It shapes evidence by imposing
discrete phases of allowable leeway in clock readings; and it generates a
mathematical form of evidence that neither assumes a geometry nor assumes
quantum states, and so separates statements of evidence from further
assumptions required to explain that evidence, whether the explanations are
made in quantum terms or in terms of general relativity. Cleansed of
unnecessary assumptions, these expressions of evidence form a platform on which
to consider the working together of general relativity and quantum theory as
explanatory language for evidence from clock networks, such as the Global
Positioning System. Quantum theory puts Planck's constant into explanations of
the required timing leeway, while explanations of leeway also draw on the
theory of general relativity, prompting the question: does Planck's constant in
the timing leeway put the long known tension between quantum theory and general
relativity in a new light?

monochrome picture matches a given template (or one out of a set of templates).
As a major advantage to classical pattern recognition, the algorithm just
requires a few incident photons and is thus suitable for very sensitive
pictures (similar to the Elitzur-Vaidman problem). Furthermore, for a
$2^{n}\times 2^{m}$ image, $\ord(n+m)$ qubits are sufficient. Using the quantum
Fourier transform, it is possible to improve the fault tolerance of the quantum
algorithm by filtering out small-scale noise in the picture. For example images
with $512\times512$ pixels, we have numerically simulated the unitary
operations in order to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm and to
analyze its fault tolerance.

mathematical wave-pattern recognition theory emerged in the 70's in connection

the emerging mathematical theory of quantum statistics.

not only quantum matter waves but also classical wave patterns like optical and
acoustic waves. We conclude that Hilbert space and operator methods developed
in quantum theory are equally useful in the classical wave theory, as soon as
the possible observations are restricted to only intensity distributions of
waves, i.e. when the wave states are not the allowed observables, as they are
not the observables of individual particles in the quantum theory. We show that
all characteristic attributes of quantum theory such as complementarity,

recently proposed. In this model binary patterns of n bits are stored in the
quantum superposition of the appropriate subset of the computational basis of n
qbits. Information can be retrieved by performing an input-dependent rotation
of the memory quantum state within this subset and measuring the resulting
state. The amplitudes of this rotated memory state are peaked on those stored
patterns which are closest in Hamming distance to the input, resulting in a
high probability of measuring a memory pattern very similar to it. The accuracy
of pattern recall can be tuned by adjusting a parameter playing the role of an
effective temperature. This model solves the well-known capacity shortage
problem of classical associative memories, providing an exponential improvement
in capacity. The price to pay is the probabilistic nature of information
retrieval, a feature that, however, this model shares with our own brain.
